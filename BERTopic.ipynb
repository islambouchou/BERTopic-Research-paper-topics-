We describe a new algorithm, the (k, `)-pebble game with colors, and use it to obtain a charac-\\nterization of the family of (k, `)-sparse graphs and algorithmic solutions to a family of problems concern-\\ning tree decompositions of graphs. Special instances of sparse graphs appear in rigidity theory and have\\nreceived increased attention in recent years. In particular, our colored pebbles generalize and strengthen\\nthe previous results of Lee and Streinu [12] and give a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-Williams characteri-\\nzation of arboricity. We also present a new decomposition that certifies sparsity based on the (k, `)-pebble\\ngame with colors. Our work also exposes connections between pebble game algorithms and previous\\nsparse graph algorithms by Gabow [5], Gabow and Westermann [6] and Hendrickson [9].\\n1. Introduction and preliminaries\\nThe focus of this paper is decompositions of (k, `)-sparse graphs into edge-disjoint subgraphs\\nthat certify sparsity. We use graph to mean a multigraph, possibly with loops. We say that a\\ngraph is (k, `)-sparse if no subset of n′ vertices spans more than kn′− ` edges in the graph; a\\n(k, `)-sparse graph with kn′− ` edges is (k, `)-tight. We call the range k ≤ `≤ 2k−1 the upper\\nrange of sparse graphs and 0≤ `≤ k the lower range.\\nIn this paper, we present efficient algorithms for finding decompositions that certify sparsity\\nin the upper range of `. Our algorithms also apply in the lower range, which was already ad-\\ndressed by [3, 4, 5, 6, 19]. A decomposition certifies the sparsity of a graph if the sparse graphs\\nand graphs admitting the decomposition coincide.\\nOur algorithms are based on a new characterization of sparse graphs, which we call the\\npebble game with colors. The pebble game with colors is a simple graph construction rule that\\nproduces a sparse graph along with a sparsity-certifying decomposition.\\nWe define and study a canonical class of pebble game constructions, which correspond to\\npreviously studied decompositions of sparse graphs into edge disjoint trees. Our results provide\\na unifying framework for all the previously known special cases, including Nash-Williams-\\nTutte and [7, 24]. Indeed, in the lower range, canonical pebble game constructions capture the\\nproperties of the augmenting paths used in matroid union and intersection algorithms[5, 6].\\nSince the sparse graphs in the upper range are not known to be unions or intersections of the\\nmatroids for which there are efficient augmenting path algorithms, these do not easily apply in\\n∗ Research of both authors funded by the NSF under grants NSF CCF-0430990 and NSF-DARPA CARGO\\nCCR-0310661 to the first author.\\n2 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\\nTerm Meaning\\nSparse graph G Every non-empty subgraph on n′ vertices has ≤ kn′− ` edges\\nTight graph G G = (V,E) is sparse and |V |= n, |E|= kn− `\\nBlock H in G G is sparse, and H is a tight subgraph\\nComponent H of G G is sparse and H is a maximal block\\nMap-graph Graph that admits an out-degree-exactly-one orientation\\n(k, `)-maps-and-trees Edge-disjoint union of ` trees and (k− `) map-grpahs\\n`Tk Union of ` trees, each vertex is in exactly k of them\\nSet of tree-pieces of an `Tk induced on V ′ ⊂V Pieces of trees in the `Tk spanned by E(V ′)\\nProper `Tk Every V ′ ⊂V contains ≥ ` pieces of trees from the `Tk\\nTable 1.

Pebble game with colors constructions may thus be considered a strengthening\\nof augmenting paths to the upper range of matroidal sparse graphs.\\n1.1. Sparse graphs\\nA graph is (k, `)-sparse if for any non-empty subgraph with m′ edges and n′ vertices, m′ ≤\\nkn′− `. We observe that this condition implies that 0 ≤ ` ≤ 2k− 1, and from now on in this\\npaper we will make this assumption. A sparse graph that has n vertices and exactly kn−` edges\\nis called tight.\\nFor a graph G = (V,E), and V ′ ⊂ V , we use the notation span(V ′) for the number of edges\\nin the subgraph induced by V ′. In a directed graph, out(V ′) is the number of edges with the tail\\nin V ′ and the head in V −V ′; for a subgraph induced by V ′, we call such an edge an out-edge.\\nThere are two important types of subgraphs of sparse graphs. A block is a tight subgraph of\\na sparse graph. A component is a maximal block.\\nTable 1 summarizes the sparse graph terminology used in this paper.\\n1.2. Sparsity-certifying decompositions\\nA k-arborescence is a graph that admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint spanning trees.\\nFigure 1(a) shows an example of a 3-arborescence. The k-arborescent graphs are described\\nby the well-known theorems of Tutte [23] and Nash-Williams [17] as exactly the (k,k)-tight\\ngraphs.\\nA map-graph is a graph that admits an orientation such that the out-degree of each vertex is\\nexactly one. A k-map-graph is a graph that admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint map-\\ngraphs. Figure 1(b) shows an example of a 2-map-graphs; the edges are oriented in one possible\\nconfiguration certifying that each color forms a map-graph. Map-graphs may be equivalently\\ndefined (see, e.g., [18]) as having exactly one cycle per connected component.1\\nA (k, `)-maps-and-trees is a graph that admits a decomposition into k− ` edge-disjoint\\nmap-graphs and ` spanning trees.\\nAnother characterization of map-graphs, which we will use extensively in this paper, is as\\nthe (1,0)-tight graphs [8, 24]. The k-map-graphs are evidently (k,0)-tight, and [8, 24] show that\\nthe converse holds as well.\\n1 Our terminology follows Lovász in [16]. In the matroid literature map-graphs are sometimes known as bases\\nof the bicycle matroid or spanning pseudoforests.\\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 3\\nFig. 1. Examples of sparsity-certifying decompositions: (a) a 3-arborescence; (b) a 2-map-graph; (c) a\\n(2,1)-maps-and-trees. Edges with the same line style belong to the same subgraph. The 2-map-graph is\\nshown with a certifying orientation.\\nA `Tk is a decomposition into ` edge-disjoint (not necessarily spanning) trees such that each\\nvertex is in exactly k of them. Figure 2(a) shows an example of a 3T2.\\nGiven a subgraph G′ of a `Tk graph G, the set of tree-pieces in G′ is the collection of the\\ncomponents of the trees in G induced by G′ (since G′ is a subgraph each tree may contribute\\nmultiple pieces to the set of tree-pieces in G′). We observe that these tree-pieces may come\\nfrom the same tree or be single-vertex “empty trees.” It is also helpful to note that the definition\\nof a tree-piece is relative to a specific subgraph. An `Tk decomposition is proper if the set of\\ntree-pieces in any subgraph G′ has size at least `.\\nFigure 2(a) shows a graph with a 3T2 decomposition; we note that one of the trees is an\\nisolated vertex in the bottom-right corner. The subgraph in Figure 2(b) has three black tree-\\npieces and one gray tree-piece: an isolated vertex at the top-right corner, and two single edges.\\nThese count as three tree-pieces, even though they come from the same back tree when the\\nwhole graph in considered. Figure 2(c) shows another subgraph; in this case there are three\\ngray tree-pieces and one black one.\\nTable 1 contains the decomposition terminology used in this paper.\\nThe decomposition problem. We define the decomposition problem for sparse graphs as tak-\\ning a graph as its input and producing as output, a decomposition that can be used to certify spar-\\nsity. In this paper, we will study three kinds of outputs: maps-and-trees; proper `Tk decompositions;\\nand the pebble-game-with-colors decomposition, which is defined in the next section.\\n2. Historical background\\nThe well-known theorems of Tutte [23] and Nash-Williams [17] relate the (k,k)-tight graphs to\\nthe existence of decompositions into edge-disjoint spanning trees. Taking a matroidal viewpoint,\\n4 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\\nFig. 2. (a) A graph with a 3T2 decomposition; one of the three trees is a single vertex in the bottom right\\ncorner. (b) The highlighted subgraph inside the dashed countour has three black tree-pieces and one gray\\ntree-piece. (c) The highlighted subgraph inside the dashed countour has three gray tree-pieces (one is a\\nsingle vertex) and one black tree-piece.\\nEdmonds [3, 4] gave another proof of this result using matroid unions. The equivalence of maps-\\nand-trees graphs and tight graphs in the lower range is shown using matroid unions in [24], and\\nmatroid augmenting paths are the basis of the algorithms for the lower range of [5, 6, 19].\\nIn rigidity theory a foundational theorem of Laman [11] shows that (2,3)-tight (Laman)\\ngraphs correspond to generically minimally rigid bar-and-joint frameworks in the plane. Tay\\n[21] proved an analogous result for body-bar frameworks in any dimension using (k,k)-tight\\ngraphs. Rigidity by counts motivated interest in the upper range, and Crapo [2] proved the\\nequivalence of Laman graphs and proper 3T2 graphs. Tay [22] used this condition to give a\\ndirect proof of Laman’s theorem and generalized the 3T2 condition to all `Tk for k≤ `≤ 2k−1.\\nHaas [7] studied `Tk decompositions in detail and proved the equivalence of tight graphs and\\nproper `Tk graphs for the general upper range. We observe that aside from our new pebble-\\ngame-with-colors decomposition, all the combinatorial characterizations of the upper range of\\nsparse graphs, including the counts, have a geometric interpretation [11, 21, 22, 24].\\nA pebble game algorithm was first proposed in [10] as an elegant alternative to Hendrick-\\nson’s Laman graph algorithms [9]. Berg and Jordan [1], provided the formal analysis of the\\npebble game of [10] and introduced the idea of playing the game on a directed graph. Lee and\\nStreinu [12] generalized the pebble game to the entire range of parameters 0≤ `≤ 2k−1, and\\nleft as an open problem using the pebble game to find sparsity certifying decompositions.\\n3. The pebble game with colors\\nOur pebble game with colors is a set of rules for constructing graphs indexed by nonnegative\\nintegers k and `. We will use the pebble game with colors as the basis of an efficient algorithm\\nfor the decomposition problem later in this paper. Since the phrase “with colors” is necessary\\nonly for comparison to [12], we will omit it in the rest of the paper when the context is clear.\\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 5\\nWe now present the pebble game with colors. The game is played by a single player on a\\nfixed finite set of vertices. The player makes a finite sequence of moves; a move consists in the\\naddition and/or orientation of an edge. At any moment of time, the state of the game is captured\\nby a directed graph H, with colored pebbles on vertices and edges. The edges of H are colored\\nby the pebbles on them. While playing the pebble game all edges are directed, and we use the\\nnotation vw to indicate a directed edge from v to w.\\nWe describe the pebble game with colors in terms of its initial configuration and the allowed\\nmoves.\\nFig. 3. Examples of pebble game with colors moves: (a) add-edge. (b) pebble-slide. Pebbles on vertices\\nare shown as black or gray dots. Edges are colored with the color of the pebble on them.\\nInitialization: In the beginning of the pebble game, H has n vertices and no edges. We start\\nby placing k pebbles on each vertex of H, one of each color ci, for i = 1,2, . . . ,k.\\nAdd-edge-with-colors: Let v and w be vertices with at least `+1 pebbles on them. Assume\\n(w.l.o.g.) that v has at least one pebble on it. Pick up a pebble from v, add the oriented edge vw\\nto E(H) and put the pebble picked up from v on the new edge.\\nFigure 3(a) shows examples of the add-edge move.\\nPebble-slide: Let w be a vertex with a pebble p on it, and let vw be an edge in H. Replace\\nvw with wv in E(H); put the pebble that was on vw on v; and put p on wv.\\nNote that the color of an edge can change with a pebble-slide move. Figure 3(b) shows\\nexamples. The convention in these figures, and throughout this paper, is that pebbles on vertices\\nare represented as colored dots, and that edges are shown in the color of the pebble on them.\\nFrom the definition of the pebble-slide move, it is easy to see that a particular pebble is\\nalways either on the vertex where it started or on an edge that has this vertex as the tail. However,\\nwhen making a sequence of pebble-slide moves that reverse the orientation of a path in H, it is\\nsometimes convenient to think of this path reversal sequence as bringing a pebble from the end\\nof the path to the beginning.\\nThe output of playing the pebble game is its complete configuration.\\nOutput: At the end of the game, we obtain the directed graph H, along with the location\\nand colors of the pebbles. Observe that since each edge has exactly one pebble on it, the pebble\\ngame configuration colors the edges.\\nWe say that the underlying undirected graph G of H is constructed by the (k, `)-pebble game\\nor that H is a pebble-game graph.\\nSince each edge of H has exactly one pebble on it, the pebble game’s configuration partitions\\nthe edges of H, and thus G, into k different colors. We call this decomposition of H a pebble-\\ngame-with-colors decomposition. Figure 4(a) shows an example of a (2,2)-tight graph with a\\npebble-game decomposition.\\nLet G = (V,E) be pebble-game graph with the coloring induced by the pebbles on the edges,\\nand let G′ be a subgraph of G. Then the coloring of G induces a set of monochromatic con-\\n6 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\\n(a) (b) (c)\\nFig. 4. A (2,2)-tight graph with one possible pebble-game decomposition.

Such a monochromatic\\nsubgraph is called a map-graph-piece of G′ if it contains a cycle (in G′) and a tree-piece of G′\\notherwise. The set of tree-pieces of G′ is the collection of tree-pieces induced by G′. As with\\nthe corresponding definition for `Tk s, the set of tree-pieces is defined relative to a specific sub-\\ngraph; in particular a tree-piece may be part of a larger cycle that includes edges not spanned\\nby G′.\\nThe properties of pebble-game decompositions are studied in Section 6, and Theorem 2\\nshows that each color must be (1,0)-sparse. The orientation of the edges in Figure 4(a) shows\\nthis.\\nFor example Figure 4(a) shows a (2,2)-tight graph with one possible pebble-game decom-\\nposition. The whole graph contains a gray tree-piece and a black tree-piece that is an isolated\\nvertex. The subgraph in Figure 4(b) has a black tree and a gray tree, with the edges of the black\\ntree coming from a cycle in the larger graph. In Figure 4(c), however, the black cycle does not\\ncontribute a tree-piece. All three tree-pieces in this subgraph are single-vertex gray trees.\\nIn the following discussion, we use the notation peb(v) for the number of pebbles on v and\\npebi(v) to indicate the number of pebbles of colors i on v.\\nTable 2 lists the pebble game notation used in this paper.\\n4. Our Results\\nWe describe our results in this section. The rest of the paper provides the proofs.\\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 7\\nOur first result is a strengthening of the pebble games of [12] to include colors. It says\\nthat sparse graphs are exactly pebble game graphs. Recall that from now on, all pebble games\\ndiscussed in this paper are our pebble game with colors unless noted explicitly.\\nTheorem 1 (Sparse graphs and pebble-game graphs coincide). A graph G is (k, `)-sparse\\nwith 0≤ `≤ 2k−1 if and only if G is a pebble-game graph.\\nNext we consider pebble-game decompositions, showing that they are a generalization of\\nproper `Tk decompositions that extend to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs.\\nTheorem 2 (The pebble-game-with-colors decomposition). A graph G is a pebble-game\\ngraph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint subgraphs such that each\\nis (1,0)-sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ` tree-pieces of the (1,0)-sparse\\ngraphs in the decomposition.\\nThe (1,0)-sparse subgraphs in the statement of Theorem 2 are the colors of the pebbles; thus\\nTheorem 2 gives a characterization of the pebble-game-with-colors decompositions obtained\\nby playing the pebble game defined in the previous section. Notice the similarity between the\\nrequirement that the set of tree-pieces have size at least ` in Theorem 2 and the definition of a\\nproper `Tk .\\nOur next results show that for any pebble-game graph, we can specialize its pebble game\\nconstruction to generate a decomposition that is a maps-and-trees or proper `Tk . We call these\\nspecialized pebble game constructions canonical, and using canonical pebble game construc-\\ntions, we obtain new direct proofs of existing arboricity results.\\nWe observe Theorem 2 that maps-and-trees are special cases of the pebble-game decompo-\\nsition: both spanning trees and spanning map-graphs are (1,0)-sparse, and each of the spanning\\ntrees contributes at least one piece of tree to every subgraph.\\nThe case of proper `Tk graphs is more subtle; if each color in a pebble-game decomposition\\nis a forest, then we have found a proper `Tk , but this class is a subset of all possible proper\\n`Tk decompositions of a tight graph. We show that this class of proper `Tk decompositions is\\nsufficient to certify sparsity.\\nWe now state the main theorem for the upper and lower range.\\nTheorem 3 (Main Theorem (Lower Range): Maps-and-trees coincide with pebble-game\\ngraphs). Let 0 ≤ ` ≤ k. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if G is a (k, `)-\\nmaps-and-trees.\\nTheorem 4 (Main Theorem (Upper Range): Proper `Tk graphs coincide with pebble-game\\ngraphs). Let k≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if it is a proper\\n`Tk with kn− ` edges.\\nAs corollaries, we obtain the existing decomposition results for sparse graphs.\\nCorollary 5 (Nash-Williams [17], Tutte [23], White and Whiteley [24]). Let `≤ k. A graph\\nG is tight if and only if has a (k, `)-maps-and-trees decomposition.\\nCorollary 6 (Crapo [2], Haas [7]). Let k ≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is tight if and only if it is a\\nproper `Tk .\\nEfficiently finding canonical pebble game constructions. The proofs of Theorem 3 and Theo-\\nrem 4 lead to an obvious algorithm with O(n3) running time for the decomposition problem.\\nOur last result improves on this, showing that a canonical pebble game construction, and thus\\n8 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\\na maps-and-trees or proper `Tk decomposition can be found using a pebble game algorithm in\\nO(n2) time and space.\\nThese time and space bounds mean that our algorithm can be combined with those of [12]\\nwithout any change in complexity.\\n5. Pebble game graphs\\nIn this section we prove Theorem 1, a strengthening of results from [12] to the pebble game\\nwith colors. Since many of the relevant properties of the pebble game with colors carry over\\ndirectly from the pebble games of [12], we refer the reader there for the proofs.\\nWe begin by establishing some invariants that hold during the execution of the pebble game.\\nLemma 7 (Pebble game invariants). During the execution of the pebble game, the following\\ninvariants are maintained in H:\\n(I1) There are at least ` pebbles on V . [12]\\n(I2) For each vertex v, span(v)+out(v)+peb(v) = k. [12]\\n(I3) For each V ′ ⊂V , span(V ′)+out(V ′)+peb(V ′) = kn′. [12]\\n(I4) For every vertex v ∈V , outi(v)+pebi(v) = 1.\\n(I5) Every maximal path consisting only of edges with color ci ends in either the first vertex with\\na pebble of color ci or a cycle.\\nProof. (I1), (I2), and (I3) come directly from [12].\\n(I4) This invariant clearly holds at the initialization phase of the pebble game with colors.\\nThat add-edge and pebble-slide moves preserve (I4) is clear from inspection.\\n(I5) By (I4), a monochromatic path of edges is forced to end only at a vertex with a pebble of\\nthe same color on it. If there is no pebble of that color reachable, then the path must eventually\\nvisit some vertex twice.\\nFrom these invariants, we can show that the pebble game constructible graphs are sparse.\\nLemma 8 (Pebble-game graphs are sparse [12]). Let H be a graph constructed with the\\npebble game. Then H is sparse. If there are exactly ` pebbles on V (H), then H is tight.\\nThe main step in proving that every sparse graph is a pebble-game graph is the following.\\nRecall that by bringing a pebble to v we mean reorienting H with pebble-slide moves to reduce\\nthe out degree of v by one.\\nLemma 9 (The `+1 pebble condition [12]). Let vw be an edge such that H + vw is sparse. If\\npeb({v,w}) < `+1, then a pebble not on {v,w} can be brought to either v or w.\\nIt follows that any sparse graph has a pebble game construction.\\nTheorem 1 (Sparse graphs and pebble-game graphs coincide). A graph G is (k, `)-sparse\\nwith 0≤ `≤ 2k−1 if and only if G is a pebble-game graph.\\n6. The pebble-game-with-colors decomposition\\nIn this section we prove Theorem 2, which characterizes all pebble-game decompositions. We\\nstart with the following lemmas about the structure of monochromatic connected components\\nin H, the directed graph maintained during the pebble game.\\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 9\\nLemma 10 (Monochromatic pebble game subgraphs are (1,0)-sparse). Let Hi be the sub-\\ngraph of H induced by edges with pebbles of color ci on them. Then Hi is (1,0)-sparse, for\\ni = 1, . . . ,k.\\nProof. By (I4) Hi is a set of edges with out degree at most one for every vertex.\\nLemma 11 (Tree-pieces in a pebble-game graph). Every subgraph of the directed graph H\\nin a pebble game construction contains at least ` monochromatic tree-pieces, and each of these\\nis rooted at either a vertex with a pebble on it or a vertex that is the tail of an out-edge.\\nRecall that an out-edge from a subgraph H ′ = (V ′,E ′) is an edge vw with v∈V ′ and vw /∈ E ′.\\nProof. Let H ′ = (V ′,E ′) be a non-empty subgraph of H, and assume without loss of generality\\nthat H ′ is induced by V ′. By (I3), out(V ′)+ peb(V ′) ≥ `. We will show that each pebble and\\nout-edge tail is the root of a tree-piece.\\nConsider a vertex v ∈ V ′ and a color ci. By (I4) there is a unique monochromatic directed\\npath of color ci starting at v. By (I5), if this path ends at a pebble, it does not have a cycle.\\nSimilarly, if this path reaches a vertex that is the tail of an out-edge also in color ci (i.e., if the\\nmonochromatic path from v leaves V ′), then the path cannot have a cycle in H ′.\\nSince this argument works for any vertex in any color, for each color there is a partitioning\\nof the vertices into those that can reach each pebble, out-edge tail, or cycle. It follows that each\\npebble and out-edge tail is the root of a monochromatic tree, as desired.\\nApplied to the whole graph Lemma 11 gives us the following.\\nLemma 12 (Pebbles are the roots of trees). In any pebble game configuration, each pebble of\\ncolor ci is the root of a (possibly empty) monochromatic tree-piece of color ci.\\nRemark: Haas showed in [7] that in a `Tk , a subgraph induced by n′ ≥ 2 vertices with m′\\nedges has exactly kn′−m′ tree-pieces in it. Lemma 11 strengthens Haas’ result by extending it\\nto the lower range and giving a construction that finds the tree-pieces, showing the connection\\nbetween the `+1 pebble condition and the hereditary condition on proper `Tk .\\nWe conclude our investigation of arbitrary pebble game constructions with a description of\\nthe decomposition induced by the pebble game with colors.\\nTheorem 2 (The pebble-game-with-colors decomposition). A graph G is a pebble-game\\ngraph if and only if it admits a decomposition into k edge-disjoint subgraphs such that each\\nis (1,0)-sparse and every subgraph of G contains at least ` tree-pieces of the (1,0)-sparse\\ngraphs in the decomposition.\\nProof. Let G be a pebble-game graph. The existence of the k edge-disjoint (1,0)-sparse sub-\\ngraphs was shown in Lemma 10, and Lemma 11 proves the condition on subgraphs.\\nFor the other direction, we observe that a color ci with ti tree-pieces in a given subgraph can\\nspan at most n− ti edges; summing over all the colors shows that a graph with a pebble-game\\ndecomposition must be sparse. Apply Theorem 1 to complete the proof.\\nRemark: We observe that a pebble-game decomposition for a Laman graph may be read out\\nof the bipartite matching used in Hendrickson’s Laman graph extraction algorithm [9]. Indeed,\\npebble game orientations have a natural correspondence with the bipartite matchings used in\\n10 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\\nMaps-and-trees are a special case of pebble-game decompositions for tight graphs: if there\\nare no cycles in ` of the colors, then the trees rooted at the corresponding ` pebbles must be\\nspanning, since they have n− 1 edges. Also, if each color forms a forest in an upper range\\npebble-game decomposition, then the tree-pieces condition ensures that the pebble-game de-\\ncomposition is a proper `Tk .\\nIn the next section, we show that the pebble game can be specialized to correspond to maps-\\nand-trees and proper `Tk decompositions.\\n7. Canonical Pebble Game Constructions\\nIn this section we prove the main theorems (Theorem 3 and Theorem 4), continuing the inves-\\ntigation of decompositions induced by pebble game constructions by studying the case where a\\nminimum number of monochromatic cycles are created. The main idea, captured in Lemma 15\\nand illustrated in Figure 6, is to avoid creating cycles while collecting pebbles. We show that\\nthis is always possible, implying that monochromatic map-graphs are created only when we\\nadd more than k(n′−1) edges to some set of n′ vertices. For the lower range, this implies that\\nevery color is a forest. Every decomposition characterization of tight graphs discussed above\\nfollows immediately from the main theorem, giving new proofs of the previous results in a\\nunified framework.\\nIn the proof, we will use two specializations of the pebble game moves. The first is a modi-\\nfication of the add-edge move.\\nCanonical add-edge: When performing an add-edge move, cover the new edge with a color\\nthat is on both vertices if possible. If not, then take the highest numbered color present.\\nThe second is a restriction on which pebble-slide moves we allow.\\nCanonical pebble-slide: A pebble-slide move is allowed only when it does not create a\\nmonochromatic cycle.\\nWe call a pebble game construction that uses only these moves canonical. In this section\\nwe will show that every pebble-game graph has a canonical pebble game construction (Lemma\\n14 and Lemma 15) and that canonical pebble game constructions correspond to proper `Tk and\\nmaps-and-trees decompositions (Theorem 3 and Theorem 4).\\nWe begin with a technical lemma that motivates the definition of canonical pebble game\\nconstructions. It shows that the situations disallowed by the canonical moves are all the ways\\nfor cycles to form in the lowest ` colors.\\nLemma 13 (Monochromatic cycle creation). Let v ∈ V have a pebble p of color ci on it and\\nlet w be a vertex in the same tree of color ci as v. A monochromatic cycle colored ci is created\\nin exactly one of the following ways:\\n(M1) The edge vw is added with an add-edge move.\\n(M2) The edge wv is reversed by a pebble-slide move and the pebble p is used to cover the reverse\\nedge vw.\\nProof. Observe that the preconditions in the statement of the lemma are implied by Lemma 7.\\nBy Lemma 12 monochromatic cycles form when the last pebble of color ci is removed from a\\nconnected monochromatic subgraph. (M1) and (M2) are the only ways to do this in a pebble\\ngame construction, since the color of an edge only changes when it is inserted the first time or\\na new pebble is put on it by a pebble-slide move.\\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 11\\nvw vw\\nFig. 5. Creating monochromatic cycles in a (2,0)-pebble game. (a) A type (M1) move creates a cycle by\\nadding a black edge. (b) A type (M2) move creates a cycle with a pebble-slide move. The vertices are\\nlabeled according to their role in the definition of the moves.\\nFigure 5(a) and Figure 5(b) show examples of (M1) and (M2) map-graph creation moves,\\nrespectively, in a (2,0)-pebble game construction.\\nWe next show that if a graph has a pebble game construction, then it has a canonical peb-\\nble game construction. This is done in two steps, considering the cases (M1) and (M2) sepa-\\nrately. The proof gives two constructions that implement the canonical add-edge and canonical\\npebble-slide moves.\\nLemma 14 (The canonical add-edge move). Let G be a graph with a pebble game construc-\\ntion. Cycle creation steps of type (M1) can be eliminated in colors ci for 1 ≤ i ≤ `′, where\\n`′ = min{k, `}.\\nProof. For add-edge moves, cover the edge with a color present on both v and w if possible. If\\nthis is not possible, then there are `+1 distinct colors present. Use the highest numbered color\\nto cover the new edge.\\nRemark: We note that in the upper range, there is always a repeated color, so no canonical\\nadd-edge moves create cycles in the upper range.\\nThe canonical pebble-slide move is defined by a global condition. To prove that we obtain\\nthe same class of graphs using only canonical pebble-slide moves, we need to extend Lemma\\n9 to only canonical moves. The main step is to show that if there is any sequence of moves that\\nreorients a path from v to w, then there is a sequence of canonical moves that does the same\\nthing.\\nLemma 15 (The canonical pebble-slide move). Any sequence of pebble-slide moves leading\\nto an add-edge move can be replaced with one that has no (M2) steps and allows the same\\nadd-edge move.\\nIn other words, if it is possible to collect `+ 1 pebbles on the ends of an edge to be added,\\nthen it is possible to do this without creating any monochromatic cycles.\\n12 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\\nFigure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the construction used in the proof of Lemma 15. We call this\\nthe shortcut construction by analogy to matroid union and intersection augmenting paths used\\nin previous work on the lower range.\\nFigure 6 shows the structure of the proof. The shortcut construction removes an (M2) step\\nat the beginning of a sequence that reorients a path from v to w with pebble-slides. Since one\\napplication of the shortcut construction reorients a simple path from a vertex w′ to w, and a\\npath from v to w′ is preserved, the shortcut construction can be applied inductively to find the\\nsequence of moves we want.\\nFig. 6. Outline of the shortcut construction: (a) An arbitrary simple path from v to w with curved lines\\nindicating simple paths. (b) An (M2) step. The black edge, about to be flipped, would create a cycle,\\nshown in dashed and solid gray, of the (unique) gray tree rooted at w. The solid gray edges were part\\nof the original path from (a). (c) The shortened path to the gray pebble; the new path follows the gray\\ntree all the way from the first time the original path touched the gray tree at w′. The path from v to w′ is\\nsimple, and the shortcut construction can be applied inductively to it.\\nProof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that our sequence of moves reorients a simple\\npath in H, and that the first move (the end of the path) is (M2). The (M2) step moves a pebble\\nof color ci from a vertex w onto the edge vw, which is reversed. Because the move is (M2), v\\nand w are contained in a maximal monochromatic tree of color ci. Call this tree H ′i , and observe\\nthat it is rooted at w.\\nNow consider the edges reversed in our sequence of moves. As noted above, before we make\\nany of the moves, these sketch out a simple path in H ending at w. Let z be the first vertex on\\nthis path in H ′i . We modify our sequence of moves as follows: delete, from the beginning, every\\nmove before the one that reverses some edge yz; prepend onto what is left a sequence of moves\\nthat moves the pebble on w to z in H ′i .\\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 13\\nFig. 7. Eliminating (M2) moves: (a) an (M2) move; (b) avoiding the (M2) by moving along another path.\\nThe path where the pebbles move is indicated by doubled lines.\\nFig. 8. Eliminating (M2) moves: (a) the first step to move the black pebble along the doubled path is\\n(M2); (b) avoiding the (M2) and simplifying the path.\\nSince no edges change color in the beginning of the new sequence, we have eliminated\\nthe (M2) move. Because our construction does not change any of the edges involved in the\\nremaining tail of the original sequence, the part of the original path that is left in the new\\nsequence will still be a simple path in H, meeting our initial hypothesis.\\nThe rest of the lemma follows by induction.\\nTogether Lemma 14 and Lemma 15 prove the following.\\nLemma 16. If G is a pebble-game graph, then G has a canonical pebble game construction.\\nUsing canonical pebble game constructions, we can identify the tight pebble-game graphs\\nwith maps-and-trees and `Tk graphs.\\n14 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\\nTheorem 3 (Main Theorem (Lower Range): Maps-and-trees coincide with pebble-game\\ngraphs). Let 0 ≤ ` ≤ k. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if G is a (k, `)-\\nmaps-and-trees.\\nProof. As observed above, a maps-and-trees decomposition is a special case of the pebble game\\ndecomposition. Applying Theorem 2, we see that any maps-and-trees must be a pebble-game\\ngraph.\\nFor the reverse direction, consider a canonical pebble game construction of a tight graph.\\nFrom Lemma 8, we see that there are ` pebbles left on G at the end of the construction. The\\ndefinition of the canonical add-edge move implies that there must be at least one pebble of\\neach ci for i = 1,2, . . . , `. It follows that there is exactly one of each of these colors. By Lemma\\n12, each of these pebbles is the root of a monochromatic tree-piece with n− 1 edges, yielding\\nthe required ` edge-disjoint spanning trees.\\nCorollary 5 (Nash-Williams [17], Tutte [23], White and Whiteley [24]). Let `≤ k. A graph\\nG is tight if and only if has a (k, `)-maps-and-trees decomposition.\\nWe next consider the decompositions induced by canonical pebble game constructions when\\n`≥ k +1.\\nTheorem 4 (Main Theorem (Upper Range): Proper Trees-and-trees coincide with peb-\\nble-game graphs). Let k≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is a tight pebble-game graph if and only if it\\nis a proper `Tk with kn− ` edges.\\nProof. As observed above, a proper `Tk decomposition must be sparse. What we need to show\\nis that a canonical pebble game construction of a tight graph produces a proper `Tk .\\nBy Theorem 2 and Lemma 16, we already have the condition on tree-pieces and the decom-\\nposition into ` edge-disjoint trees. Finally, an application of (I4), shows that every vertex must\\nin in exactly k of the trees, as required.\\nCorollary 6 (Crapo [2], Haas [7]). Let k ≤ `≤ 2k−1. A graph G is tight if and only if it is a\\nproper `Tk .\\n8. Pebble game algorithms for finding decompositions\\nA naı̈ve implementation of the constructions in the previous section leads to an algorithm re-\\nquiring Θ(n2) time to collect each pebble in a canonical construction: in the worst case Θ(n)\\napplications of the construction in Lemma 15 requiring Θ(n) time each, giving a total running\\ntime of Θ(n3) for the decomposition problem.\\nIn this section, we describe algorithms for the decomposition problem that run in time\\nO(n2). We begin with the overall structure of the algorithm.\\nAlgorithm 17 (The canonical pebble game with colors).\\nInput: A graph G.\\nOutput: A pebble-game graph H.\\nMethod:\\n– Set V (H) = V (G) and place one pebble of each color on the vertices of H.\\n– For each edge vw ∈ E(G) try to collect at least `+1 pebbles on v and w using pebble-slide\\nmoves as described by Lemma 15.\\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 15\\n– If at least `+1 pebbles can be collected, add vw to H using an add-edge move as in Lemma\\n14, otherwise discard vw.\\n– Finally, return H, and the locations of the pebbles.\\nCorrectness. Theorem 1 and the result from [24] that the sparse graphs are the independent\\nsets of a matroid show that H is a maximum sized sparse subgraph of G. Since the construction\\nfound is canonical, the main theorem shows that the coloring of the edges in H gives a maps-\\nand-trees or proper `Tk decomposition.\\nComplexity. We start by observing that the running time of Algorithm 17 is the time taken to\\nprocess O(n) edges added to H and O(m) edges not added to H. We first consider the cost of an\\nedge of G that is added to H.\\nEach of the pebble game moves can be implemented in constant time. What remains is to\\ndescribe an efficient way to find and move the pebbles. We use the following algorithm as a\\nsubroutine of Algorithm 17 to do this.\\nAlgorithm 18 (Finding a canonical path to a pebble.).\\nInput: Vertices v and w, and a pebble game configuration on a directed graph H.\\nOutput: If a pebble was found, ‘yes’, and ‘no’ otherwise. The configuration of H is updated.\\nMethod:\\n– Start by doing a depth-first search from from v in H. If no pebble not on w is found, stop and\\nreturn ‘no.’\\n– Otherwise a pebble was found. We now have a path v = v1,e1, . . . ,ep−1,vp = u, where the vi\\nare vertices and ei is the edge vivi+1. Let c[ei] be the color of the pebble on ei. We will use\\nthe array c[] to keep track of the colors of pebbles on vertices and edges after we move them\\nand the array s[] to sketch out a canonical path from v to u by finding a successor for each\\nedge.\\n– Set s[u] = ‘end′ and set c[u] to the color of an arbitrary pebble on u. We walk on the path in\\nreverse order: vp,ep−1,ep−2, . . . ,e1,v1. For each i, check to see if c[vi] is set; if so, go on to\\nthe next i. Otherwise, check to see if c[vi+1] = c[ei].\\n– If it is, set s[vi] = ei and set c[vi] = c[ei], and go on to the next edge.\\n– Otherwise c[vi+1] 6= c[ei], try to find a monochromatic path in color c[vi+1] from vi to vi+1. If\\na vertex x is encountered for which c[x] is set, we have a path vi = x1, f1,x2, . . . , fq−1,xq = x\\nthat is monochromatic in the color of the edges; set c[xi] = c[ fi] and s[xi] = fi for i =\\n1,2, . . . ,q−1. If c[x] = c[ fq−1], stop. Otherwise, recursively check that there is not a monochro-\\nmatic c[x] path from xq−1 to x using this same procedure.\\n– Finally, slide pebbles along the path from the original endpoints v to u specified by the\\nsuccessor array s[v], s[s[v]], . . .\\nThe correctness of Algorithm 18 comes from the fact that it is implementing the shortcut\\nconstruction. Efficiency comes from the fact that instead of potentially moving the pebble back\\nand forth, Algorithm 18 pre-computes a canonical path crossing each edge of H at most three\\ntimes: once in the initial depth-first search, and twice while converting the initial path to a\\ncanonical one. It follows that each accepted edges takes O(n) time, for a total of O(n2) time\\nspent processing edges in H.\\nAlthough we have not discussed this explicity, for the algorithm to be efficient we need to\\nmaintain components as in [12]. After each accepted edge, the components of H can be updated\\nin time O(n). Finally, the results of [12, 13] show that the rejected edges take an amortized O(1)\\ntime each.\\n16 Ileana Streinu, Louis Theran\\nSummarizing, we have shown that the canonical pebble game with colors solves the decom-\\nposition problem in time O(n2).\\n9. An important special case: Rigidity in dimension 2 and slider-pinning\\nIn this short section we present a new application for the special case of practical importance,\\nk = 2, ` = 3. As discussed in the introduction, Laman’s theorem [11] characterizes minimally\\nrigid graphs as the (2,3)-tight graphs. In recent work on slider pinning, developed after the\\ncurrent paper was submitted, we introduced the slider-pinning model of rigidity [15, 20]. Com-\\nbinatorially, we model the bar-slider frameworks as simple graphs together with some loops\\nplaced on their vertices in such a way that there are no more than 2 loops per vertex, one of each\\ncolor.\\nWe characterize the minimally rigid bar-slider graphs [20] as graphs that are:\\n1. (2,3)-sparse for subgraphs containing no loops.\\n2. (2,0)-tight when loops are included.\\nWe call these graphs (2,0,3)-graded-tight, and they are a special case of the graded-sparse\\ngraphs studied in our paper [14].\\nThe connection with the pebble games in this paper is the following.\\nCorollary 19 (Pebble games and slider-pinning). In any (2,3)-pebble game graph, if we\\nreplace pebbles by loops, we obtain a (2,0,3)-graded-tight graph.\\nProof. Follows from invariant (I3) of Lemma 7.\\nIn [15], we study a special case of slider pinning where every slider is either vertical or\\nhorizontal. We model the sliders as pre-colored loops, with the color indicating x or y direction.\\nFor this axis parallel slider case, the minimally rigid graphs are characterized by:\\n1. (2,3)-sparse for subgraphs containing no loops.\\n2. Admit a 2-coloring of the edges so that each color is a forest (i.e., has no cycles), and each\\nmonochromatic tree spans exactly one loop of its color.\\nThis also has an interpretation in terms of colored pebble games.\\nCorollary 20 (The pebble game with colors and slider-pinning). In any canonical (2,3)-\\npebble-game-with-colors graph, if we replace pebbles by loops of the same color, we obtain the\\ngraph of a minimally pinned axis-parallel bar-slider framework.\\nProof. Follows from Theorem 4, and Lemma 12.\\n10. Conclusions and open problems\\nWe presented a new characterization of (k, `)-sparse graphs, the pebble game with colors, and\\nused it to give an efficient algorithm for finding decompositions of sparse graphs into edge-\\ndisjoint trees. Our algorithm finds such sparsity-certifying decompositions in the upper range\\nand runs in time O(n2), which is as fast as the algorithms for recognizing sparse graphs in the\\nupper range from [12].\\nWe also used the pebble game with colors to describe a new sparsity-certifying decomposi-\\ntion that applies to the entire matroidal range of sparse graphs.\\nSparsity-certifying Graph Decompositions 17\\nWe defined and studied a class of canonical pebble game constructions that correspond to\\neither a maps-and-trees or proper `Tk decomposition. This gives a new proof of the Tutte-Nash-\\nWilliams arboricity theorem and a unified proof of the previously studied decomposition cer-\\ntificates of sparsity. Canonical pebble game constructions also show the relationship between\\nthe `+1 pebble condition, which applies to the upper range of `, to matroid union augmenting\\npaths, which do not apply in the upper range.\\nAlgorithmic consequences and open problems. In [6], Gabow and Westermann give an O(n3/2)\\nalgorithm for recognizing sparse graphs in the lower range and extracting sparse subgraphs from\\ndense ones. Their technique is based on efficiently finding matroid union augmenting paths,\\nwhich extend a maps-and-trees decomposition. The O(n3/2) algorithm uses two subroutines to\\nfind augmenting paths: cyclic scanning, which finds augmenting paths one at a time, and batch\\nscanning, which finds groups of disjoint augmenting paths.\\nWe observe that Algorithm 17 can be used to replace cyclic scanning in Gabow and Wester-\\nmann’s algorithm without changing the running time. The data structures used in the implemen-\\ntation of the pebble game, detailed in [12, 13] are simpler and easier to implement than those\\nused to support cyclic scanning.\\nThe two major open algorithmic problems related to the pebble game are then:\\nProblem 1. Develop a pebble game algorithm with the properties of batch scanning and obtain\\nan implementable O(n3/2) algorithm for the lower range.\\nProblem 2. Extend batch scanning to the `+1 pebble condition and derive an O(n3/2) pebble\\ngame algorithm for the upper range.\\nIn particular, it would be of practical importance to find an implementable O(n3/2) algorithm\\nfor decompositions into edge-disjoint spanning trees.\\nReferences\\n1.

In this case the study of localised levels in \\ntechnologically relevant materials like oxadiazoles and quinoxalines is of fundamental importance. \\nSeveral scientific tools enable to study localised levels in solids and among others the thermally \\nstimulated techniques give the most direct evidence of their presence. The present work is focused on \\ntheoretical and experimental study of localised levels in organic materials suitable for light-emitting \\ndevices and field effect transistors by means of thermal techniques. \\nKeywords: thermally stimulated techniques, localised levels, organic materials, light-emitting    \\ndevices (LED), field effect transistors (FET) \\n1. Introduction  \\nThe discussion about the presence of localised states and their density naturally leads to the \\nquestion about the kind of traps we are dealing with. In a first approach we should distinguish \\nbetween intrinsic and extrinsic defects. In the first type we should inscribe polymer end groups, grain \\nboundaries, structural defects, conformational disorder up to molecular groups with large permanent \\ndipole moment that could increase the level of energetic disorder [1]. For the second type we should \\nmention the chemical impurities, somehow unavoidable in the synthesis of organic molecules. We \\ncan further distinguish the kind of traps in function of their location, interfacial or bulk, or in term of \\nenergy, deep traps or shallow traps. Also polarons could be seen, in a simplistic way, like defects \\ncaused by an electron plus an induced lattice polarisation [2] followed by a lattice distortion. Traps \\nare into the samples in a great variety and in different proportion, often despite the same preparation \\nprocedure. For that reason sometimes their nature is difficult to investigate and the data must be \\nhandled with care. \\nIn the studies of trapped states because of the above underlined variety of defects in solids the \\nmost successful approach is to start introducing a single type of defect in a well-known system in a \\ncontrolled way.  \\n2. Experimental Part \\n In our work we focused on low molecular compounds as well as on polymers, especially of \\ntwo classes of materials: oxadiazoles and quinoxalines. Both organic compounds are well know as \\nelectron transport materials in OLEDs. PPQs (see figure 1) in general show very high solubility [3] in \\na variety of common organic solvents, and according to literature they exhibit a glass transition at \\nquite high temperature (250-350 \\u00b0C).  \\nThe materials were deposited by spin coating on gold, aluminium or silicon in different speed \\nor concentration for the film optimisation. The layer thickness was controlled by Dektak techniques \\nand Ellypsometry. \\nThe thermally stimulated luminescence (TSL) and thermally stimulated current (TSC) are \\npowerful instruments in order to study de-trapping and relaxation processes in organic materials. TSL \\nis a contact less technique that allows to distinguish between deep and shallow trapping states. The \\nproposed mathematical model for the TSL enables to study trap levels and recombination centres \\ninside the band gap. The analytical solution of the rate equations allows two different de-trapping \\nregimes, including or excluding subsequent re-trapping effects. The first order solution kinetic \\nindicates that no re-trapping phenomena are permitted. The electron released from a localised level \\nrecombines with a hole in a recombination centre and its re-trapping probability, before to \\nrecombine, is negligible. The second order equation deals with the opposite extreme case. The \\nphonon-assisted release of an electron is followed by multiple re-trapping. In this second order \\nkinetic regime the probability of a released electron to get re-trapped is very high. The main factors \\ngoverning both solutions are the energy depth of the traps calculated with respect to the conduction \\nband edge and the frequency factor. This second important factor in general indicates the attempt-to-\\nescape frequency of electrons from the localised levels. The mathematical model takes also into \\naccount the occurrence of distributions of localised levels. In case of a Gaussian distribution of \\nlocalised states a meaningful parameter is the width of the distribution. Numerical simulations, \\ncalculated with the proposed model, show that while a first order peak is characterised by an \\nasymmetric peak shape with a steep decreasing side, the second order kinetic peaks are characterised \\nby a more symmetric shape. The signal is smeared along the whole peak temperature range due to the \\nre-trapping effect.  \\nFigure 1.  Poly-[2,2\\u2019-(1,4-phenylene)-6,6\\u2019-bis(3-phenylquinoxaline)] (PPQ IA) \\nThe same theoretical description holds for both techniques, TSL and TSC. However, TSC \\ntheory requires the presence of an extended conduction band. During a TSC experiment a driving \\nvoltage is applied to the sample and the de-trapped charges are extracted at the device contacts. \\nHowever, the equations describing a TSC peak are similar to equations describing TSL. Additionally, \\nit is possible to determine the density of the trapping states evaluating the area under a TSC peak.  \\nSimultaneous TSL and TSC measurements give useful information about the localised states \\ncombining the best possibilities of both thermal techniques. Unambiguous information about trap \\ndepth, density of states, kinetics order and frequency factor can be extract making use of the full \\npossibilities of the combined measurements. \\nIn typical thermally stimulated process experiments a sample is heated in a controlled way and \\nthe current, in case of TSC, or the light emission, in case of TSL, or both simultaneously are \\nmonitored. The effect appears only when an optical or electrical excitation takes place prior to the \\nheating. TSC, in contrast to TSL, requires the presence of good ohmic contacts.  \\nIn the following a TSL experiment is described in more detail and the rate equations derived. \\nThe sample, in an equilibrium state at room temperature where all the shallow traps are empty, is \\ncooled down to a low temperature. Then, it is illuminated with electromagnetic radiation of certain \\nenergy. The incident radiation excites the electrons from the valence band to the conduction band \\ntrough the gap. \\nIn the case of prompt fluorescence the generated electrons recombine promptly. Otherwise \\nthey can form an electron hole pair followed by geminate recombination or by dissociation with \\nsubsequent trapping. Charge carriers can get trapped in localised levels that, considering the random \\nfluctuation of the potential in disordered materials, are distributed in energy. From statistical \\nconsideration, the distribution type should be generally Gaussian. The thermal emission from traps at \\nlow temperature is negligibly small. Therefore, the perturbed equilibrium created by the incident \\nradiation resists for a long time and the electrons are just stored in the localised levels. \\nTemperature is then raised in a controlled way, electrons acquire energy and finally escape \\nfrom the traps by means of a phonon assisted jump and recombine with holes trough a recombination \\ncentre where recombination occurs with subsequent photon emission. By means of spectrally \\nresolved TSL experiments it is possible to get information about recombination centres studying the \\nwavelength of the emitted light as function of temperature and intensity.  \\nThe above-described processes are illustrated in figure 2. \\nThe illustrated scheme for thermoluminescence is simple, but despite of its simplicity it can \\ndescribe all fundamental features of a thermoluminescence process. Following Chen [4], the electron \\nexchange between the HOMO and LUMO levels, during the trap emptying, can be described by the \\nfollowing three differential equations: \\nh Ann\\n\\u22c5\\u22c5\\u2212=   (1) \\npnAnNn\\nc \\u22c5\\u2212\\u22c5\\u2212= )(   (2) \\nc AnnAnNnpn\\n\\u22c5\\u22c5\\u2212\\u22c5\\u2212\\u2212\\u22c5= )(  (3) \\nHere nh is the concentration of holes in the recombination centres, nc is the concentration of \\nelectrons in the conduction band, Ar is the recombination coefficient for electrons in the conduction \\nband with holes in the recombination centres, n is the concentration of electrons in traps, N is the \\nfunction describing the concentration of electron traps at depth E below the edge of the conduction \\nband, A is the transition coefficient for electrons in the conduction band becoming trapped and p is \\nthe same probability of thermal release of electrons from traps defined in equation (1), which \\nrepresents in fact their release rate. Equation (2) describes the change of hole density nh in \\nrecombination centres versus time. The recombination rate depends both from the concentration of \\nfree electrons (nc) and from the concentration of holes already present in the recombination centres \\ntrough a probability coefficient (Ar) that depends on the cross section and the thermal velocity72 of \\nelectrons. An increase in these parameters results in an increase of the recombination probability. \\nEquation (3) describes the exchange of electrons between conduction band and traps. The first term \\nin the right hand side includes the probability A for an electron to be trapped. That probability A, like \\nAr, also depends on the thermal velocity of electrons and on the cross section of traps. The second \\nterm on the right hand side is the de-trapping term. It is proportional to the concentration of trapped \\nElectron centre\\nHole centre\\nConduction band\\nValence band \\nRecombination centre\\nFigure 2. Energy diagram describing the elementary \\nprocess of the simple model for TSL \\nelectrons and to the Boltzmann\\u2019s function, i.e. equation (1). The proportionality factor s, often called \\nfrequency factor or pre-exponential factor, should be, when interpreted in terms of attempt to escape \\nof an electron from the potential well, in the order of magnitude of 1010 \\u00f7 1014 s-1. A saturation effect \\nfor carrier release from traps, caused by a limited number of available states in the conduction band, \\nis neglected in this model. In each moment the number of available states in conduction band is much \\nhigher than the released amount of electrons from the localised states [5]. \\nEquation (3) describes the variation of electron density in the conduction band and essentially \\nit takes into account the charge neutrality of the whole system. The variation rate of electrons in the \\nconduction band depends on electrons being released - first term on the right hand side-, electrons \\nbeing trapped - second term - and electrons that recombine - third term. Electrons and holes in that \\nmodel are generated at the same time - geminate couples, but they are not necessarily still bound. \\nSaturation effects due to filled deeper traps or recombination centres that have already a hole on them \\nare not considered.  \\nComplex models have the disadvantage to introduce an increased number of parameters [7]. \\nActually, several combinations of too many parameters can generate the same shape of a real glow \\ncurve, making impossible to find a most probable fit [8]. For that reason it is preferable to deal with a \\nreasonable simple model that involves few reliable parameters. Actually, the proposed simple model \\ncan successfully describe the experimental glow curves, but it is necessary to take also the energetic \\ndistribution of localised states into account in order to describe the complex behaviour of disordered \\nsystems, like amorphous polymers or organic polycrystalline thin films. In such case the total number \\nof traps is represented by the following equation (4). The traps do not have single activation energy, \\nbut they are continuously energetically distributed. \\ndEENN   (4) \\n Here N(E) can be in principle any kind of distribution, but considering the statistical disorder \\nin organic materials it should have a Gaussian shape. In principle also the frequency factor should \\nhave the same energetic distribution. In order to solve the system of differential equations (1)-(4), \\nequation (5), regarding the time dependence of temperature, should be add. \\ntTT \\u22c5+= \\u03b20   (5) \\nIn equation (5) \\u03b2 is the experimental constant heating rate. It should be note that as long as T is \\na well knows function of the time the only real variable is the time. For that reason it is very \\nimportant, experimentally, to have a perfect control of the temperature linearity. \\n3. Results and discussion \\nThe main peak in figure 3 has the maximum temperature at Tm = 159.7 K and the second, of the \\nroughly half the intensity, at Tm = 230.7 K. The peak at Tm = 159.7 K has a symmetry factor \\u00b5 = \\n0.54, very near to the typical value for a second order kinetic. This fact gives a hint that in PPQ IA an \\nelectron, before recombination, has high probability to get re-trapped several times. Because of its \\nhidden position the analysis of the minor peak of PPQ IA appearing at Tm = 230.7 K is very difficult  \\n[6]. \\n60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240\\n=230.7 K\\n= 159.7 K\\nTemperature (K)\\n40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260\\nTemperature (K)\\nFigure 3. TSL of PPQ IA Figure 4. TSL glow curve of a PPQ IA sample (red \\nline) compared with the second order numerical \\nsimulation of the first peak (green line) \\nFigure 4 shows the numerical fitting of the main TSL peak of PPQ IA. The fit is performed by \\nmeans of a second order equation characterised by a Gaussian distribution of traps. While the \\nhigh temperature side perfectly fits the glow curve, the low temperature side do not follow the \\ncurve shape. For that reason the numerical simulation is not completely satisfactory. The \\ndistribution has a width \\u03c3 = 0.12 eV and the distribution maximum is at Em = 0.37 eV. The \\nenergy maximum Em lies exactly in the middle of the integration limits E1 = 0.25 eV and E2 = \\n0.49 eV, having the distribution in such case a perfect Gaussian shape. The natural frequency s of \\nthis peak can be estimated to be in the order of s = 1x1010 s-1, considering, as is normal, the \\nrecombination coefficient / trapping coefficient ratio equal to 1 and a density of traps of 1014 cm-\\n3. The value of Em, derived by numerical analysis, is far from the expected energy depth of a trap \\ncalculated with the initial rise method. However, this mismatching can be explained considering \\nthe particular complexity of the peak that could result from the sum of at least two distributed \\npeaks. In effect the initial rise procedure reveals the activation energy of a hidden peak at low \\ntemperature. This is an important point to clarify because of the importance of the presence of \\nshallow traps in materials suitable for plastic electronic applications. Shallow traps are, at room \\ntemperature, empty and they play a crucial role in the electron transport property of organic \\nmaterials. For a different thickness we obtain glow curves from figure 5. \\n40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 220 240 260\\nTemperature (K)\\nFigure 5.

We measured and compared 2 samples of P3HT on SiO2 \\u2013 treated and \\nuntreated in oxygen plasma.  \\nBoth experiments were performed under the same conditions.  \\nThe concentration of the traps was estimated using (Manfredotti et. al.) the relation: \\nNT =   (6) \\nHere Q is the quantity of charge released during a TSC experiment and can be calculated from the \\narea under the TSC peaks; A and L are the area and the thickness of the sample, respectively; e is the \\nelectronic charge and G is the photoconductivity gain, which equals to the number of electrons \\npassing through the sample for each absorbed photon.

Conclusions \\nThermal techniques are a powerful tool in the to study of localised levels in inorganic and organic \\nmaterials. Thermally stimulated luminescence, thermally stimulated currents and thermally \\nstimulated depolarisation currents allow, when applied in synergy the details shallow of traps and \\ndeeper levels to be investigated. They also permit to study, in synergy with dielectric spectroscopy, \\nas polarisation and depolarisation effects. The analysis of the thermograms, emerging from the \\nthermal techniques, can be performed starting from the differential rate equations of the de-trapping \\nphenomena. Such an approach, allowed by the computing power of the modern computers, is not the \\nmost fruitful, while the number of free variables involved in the numerical resolution of the rate \\ndifferential equations is too high. Sometimes completely different sets of parameters can fit the same \\nthermally stimulated peak and ambiguous results are often achieved. \\n5.

Introduction\\nThere is no doubt that galaxies suffer chemical enrichment during their lives (see e.g.\\nCid Fernandes et al. 2006 for a recent systematic approach using a large data base of\\ngalaxies from the Sloan Digital Survey Data Release 5 \\u2013 Adelman-Mac Carthy J.K. et\\nal., 2007). The main source of oxygen production has since long been identified as due\\nto supernovae from massive stars (type II supernovae). Yet, the exact process by which\\nchemical enrichment proceeds is poorly known (see a review by Scalo & Elmegreen 2004).\\nTen years ago, Tenorio-Tagle (1996, hereafter T-T96) proposed a scenario in which the\\nmetal-enhanced ejecta from supernovae follow a long excursion in galactic haloes before\\nfalling down on the galaxies in the form of oxygen-rich droplets.\\nIn the present work (the full version of which has been submitted to Astronomy &\\nAstrophysics, Stasin\\u0301ska et al. 2007), we suggest that the discrepancy between the oxygen\\nabundances derived from optical recombination lines (ORLs) and from collisionally ex-\\ncited lines (CELs) in HII regions (see e.g. Garc\\u0301\\u0131a-Rojas et al. 2006 and references therein)\\nmight well be the signature of those oxygen-rich droplets. In fact, Tsamis et al. (2003)\\nand Pe\\u0301quignot & Tsamis (2005) already suggested that the ORL/CEL discrepancy in\\nHII regions is the result of inhomegeneities in the chemical composition in these objects.\\nOur aim is to explicit the link between the ORL/CEL discrepancy and the T-T96 sce-\\nnario, and to check whether what is known of the oxygen yields allows one to explain\\nthe ORL/CEL discrepancy in a quantitative way.\\n2.

There\\nare a lot of schemes for generating various kinds of entanglement, for example, the entanglement\\nbetween photons, the entanglement between atoms, the entanglement between trapped ions, and\\nthe entanglement between different kinds of particles (for example, between photons and atoms).\\nIn addition to the entanglement between two parties, there are also entanglement of multiparties.\\nAmong these schemes many use single-photon sources and/or single-photon detectors. Although\\nthere are great progresses in the study on these single-photon devices, how to obtain them is still a\\nchallenging task. In this paper we propose a simple scheme for generating entangled states of light\\nfields. This scheme only requires the cross-Kerr nonlinear interaction between light fields in coherent\\nstates, followed by a homodyne detection. Therefore, this scheme is within the reach of current\\ntechnology.The basic idea of this scheme is shown in Figure 1. Mode a is a bright beam which is in a\\ncoherent state |\\u03b1\\u3009. Mode b is a weak or bright beam which is also in a coherent state. BS is a 50/50\\nbeam splitter. KM1 and KM2 are Kerr media. HD means homodyne detection [2].\\nThis paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we briefly introduce the cross-Kerr nonlinear inter-\\naction between two field-modes. In section 3 and section 4 we study the generation of entanglement\\nbetween two modes and that among three modes, respectively. Section 5 is a summary.\\n\\u2217Corresponding author: zmzhang@scnu.edu.cn\\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1560v1\\n2 Cross-Kerr nonlinear interaction\\nFirst, let us briefly review the cross-Kerr nonlinear interaction between a mode A and a mode B. The\\ninteraction Hamiltonian has the form [3]\\nHCK = ~Kn\\u0302An\\u0302B, (1)\\nwhere n\\u0302A and n\\u0302B are the photon-number operator of mode A and mode B, respectively. The coupling\\ncoefficient K is proportional to the third-order nonlinear susceptibility \\u03c7(3). The time-evolution\\noperator is\\nU (t) = exp\\n= exp {\\u2212iKn\\u0302An\\u0302Bt} = exp {\\u2212i\\u03c4 n\\u0302An\\u0302B} = U (\\u03c4) , (2)\\nin which \\u03c4 = Kt = K (l/v), it can be named as the scaled interaction time, or the nonlinear phase\\nshift. Here l is the length of the Kerr medium and v is the velocity of light in the Kerr medium. The\\ncross Kerr nonlinearity has following property\\nU (\\u03c4) |n\\u3009B |\\u03b1\\u3009A = |n\\u3009B\\n\\u2223\\u03b1e\\u2212in\\u03c4\\n, (3)\\nhere |n\\u3009 and |\\u03b1\\u3009 are the photon number state and the coherent state, respectively.\\n3 Entanglement between two modes\\nNow let us study the generation of the entangled states between two modes. The scheme is shown\\nin Figure 1. Assume that mode a is in a coherent state |\\u03b1\\u3009 [4]. Mode b is also in a coherent state\\nwhich is divided by the 50/50 beam splitter BS into two beams b1 and b2, and both b1 and b2 are in\\ncoherent state |\\u03b2\\u3009.\\nWe first consider the case of weak coherent state |\\u03b2\\u3009. In this case we have\\n|\\u03b2\\u3009 \\u2248 1\\u221a\\n1 + |\\u03b2|2\\n(|0\\u3009+ \\u03b2 |1\\u3009) , (4)\\nwhere |0\\u3009 and |1\\u3009 are the vacuum state and one-photon state, respectively. Let mode a interacts with\\nmode b1 and b2 successively. For simplicity, we assume that both the scaled interaction times are \\u03c4 ,\\nthai is, \\u03c41 = K1t1 = \\u03c42 = K2t2 = \\u03c4.The interactions change the state as following way\\n|\\u03b2\\u30092 |\\u03b2\\u30091 |\\u03b1\\u3009a \\u2192\\n1 + |\\u03b2|2\\n|0\\u30092 |0\\u30091 |\\u03b1\\u3009a + \\u03b2 (|1\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |0\\u30092 |1\\u30091)\\n\\u2223\\u03b1e\\u2212i\\u03c4\\n+ \\u03b22 |1\\u30092 |1\\u30091\\n\\u2223\\u03b1e\\u2212i2\\u03c4\\nwhere the subscripts 1 and 2 denote modes b1 and b2, respectively. We note that the internal product\\nof coherent states satisfies [4]\\n\\u03b1e\\u2212in\\u03c4 |\\u03b1e\\u2212i(n+1)\\u03c4\\n= e\\u22124|\\u03b1|\\n2 sin2(\\u03c4/2) \\u2248 e\\u2212|\\u03b1|\\n2\\u03c42 , (6)\\nin which we have taken into account the fact that in practice \\u03c4 is small [3] and therefore sin (\\u03c4/2) \\u2248\\n\\u03c4/2. However, if mode a is bright enough so that |\\u03b1|2 \\u03c42 \\u226b 1, then the two coherent states will\\nbe approximately orthogonal. This condition can be easily satisfied in experiments and in following\\ndiscussions we assume that it is satisfied. In this case, a homodyne detection can distinguish different\\ncoherent states [5]. Therefore, when we find that mode a is in the coherent state\\n\\u2223\\u03b1e\\u2212i\\u03c4\\n, then beam\\nb1 and beam b2 will be projected into the entangled state\\n(|1\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |0\\u30092 |1\\u30091) , (7)\\nand the probability for getting this entangled state is 2 |\\u03b2|2 /\\n1 + |\\u03b2|2\\n.This state is one of Bell\\nstates [1] and a special case of the NOON states [6].\\nNow let us consider the general situation in which beam b1 and beam b2 are normal coherent states\\n[4]. In this situation,\\n|\\u03b2\\u3009 = exp\\n|n\\u3009 . (8)\\nThe cross-Kerr interactions transform the state as follows\\n|\\u03b2\\u30092 |\\u03b2\\u30091 |\\u03b1\\u3009a = e\\n\\u2212|\\u03b2|2\\n\\u03b2m+n\\u221a\\n|m\\u30092 |n\\u30091 |\\u03b1\\u3009a\\n\\u2192 e\\u2212|\\u03b2|\\n\\u03b2m+n\\u221a\\n|m\\u30092 |n\\u30091\\n\\u03b1e\\u2212i(m+n)\\u03c4\\n. (9)\\nIf the homedyne detection finds mode a in the state\\n\\u2223\\u03b1e\\u2212i(m+n)\\u03c4\\n\\u2223\\u03b1e\\u2212ik\\u03c4\\n(k = m+n = 1, 2, ...),\\nthen mode b1 and mode b2 will be collapse into the entangled state\\nn! (k \\u2212 n)!\\n|k \\u2212 n\\u30092 |n\\u30091 (k = 1, 2, ...). (10)\\nSince in this state the sum of photon numbers of the two modes is equal to k, we name this state as\\nthe 2-mode k-photon entangled state. The probability for getting this state is exp(\\u22122 |\\u03b2|2)2\\n|\\u03b2|2k .\\nThe entanglement property of the states expressed by Eq.(10) can be proved by using following\\nentanglement criteria [7]\\nb+1 b2\\n> \\u3008Nb1Nb2\\u3009 , (11)\\nwhere Nb1(Nb2), b1(b2) and b\\n2 ) are the photon-number operator, the photon annihilation operator\\nand the photon creation operator of mode b1(b2), respectively. For the states of equation (10), we\\ncan find\\nb+1 b2\\nk2 , and \\u3008Nb1Nb2\\u3009 = 14k (k \\u2212 1) . Therefore the entanglement condition (11) is\\nsatisfied, and the states (10) are indeed entangled states. For k = 1, equation (10) reduces to equation\\n(7), and some other examples of the 2-mode k-photon entangled states are listed below.\\n(|2\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |0\\u30092 |2\\u30091) +\\n2 |1\\u30092 |1\\u30091\\n(k = 2) (12)\\n(|3\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |0\\u30092 |3\\u30091) +\\n3 (|2\\u30092 |1\\u30091 + |1\\u30092 |2\\u30091)\\n(k = 3) (13)\\nEquations (12) and (13) are new kinds of entangled states. Equation (12) can be understood as a\\nsuperposition of a NOON state (|2\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |0\\u30092 |2\\u30091) and a product state |1\\u30092 |1\\u30091 ,while equation (13)\\ncan be understood as a superposition of a NOON state (|3\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |0\\u30092 |3\\u30091) and a NOON \\u2212 like\\nstate (|2\\u30092 |1\\u30091 + |1\\u30092 |2\\u30091). We also note that in the superposition (13) the probability of getting the\\nstate (|2\\u30092 |1\\u30091 + |1\\u30092 |2\\u30091) is larger than that of getting the state (|3\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |0\\u30092 |3\\u30091) .That is, the\\nphotons trend to distribute between the two modes symmetrically. The properties and applications\\nof these new kinds of entangled states will be studied in the future.\\n4 Entanglement among three modes\\nWe can extend the scheme above to generate the entanglement among three modes. For this purpose\\nwe modify the scheme from Figure 1 to Figure 2, in which BS1 has the reflection/transmission = 1/2\\nand BS2 has the reflection/transmission = 1/1, so that the three beams b1, b2 and b3 have the same\\nstrength, and we assume all of them are in the coherent state |\\u03b2\\u3009 . We let mode a, in a coherent state\\n|\\u03b1\\u3009, interacts with modes b1, b2 and b3 successively. And for simplicity, we assume that all of the\\nscaled interaction times are equal, thai is, \\u03c41 = \\u03c42 = \\u03c43 = \\u03c4.\\nFor the situation in which |\\u03b2\\u3009 is weak and can be expressed as in equation (4), the interactions\\ntransform the states in the following way\\n|\\u03b2\\u30093 |\\u03b2\\u30092 |\\u03b2\\u30091 |\\u03b1\\u3009a \\u2192\\n1 + |\\u03b2|2\\n{|0\\u30093 |0\\u30092 |0\\u30091 |\\u03b1\\u3009a\\n+\\u03b2 (|1\\u30093 |0\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |0\\u30093 |1\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |0\\u30093 |0\\u30092 |1\\u30091)\\n\\u2223\\u03b1e\\u2212i\\u03c4\\n+\\u03b22 (|1\\u30093 |1\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |1\\u30093 |0\\u30092 |1\\u30091 + |0\\u30093 |1\\u30092 |1\\u30091)\\n\\u2223\\u03b1e\\u2212i2\\u03c4\\n+\\u03b23 |1\\u30093 |1\\u30092 |1\\u30091\\n\\u2223\\u03b1e\\u2212i3\\u03c4\\n}. (14)\\nAs discussed above, we assume that different coherent states in above equation are approximately\\northogonal, and we can use homodyne detection to distinguish them [5]. If we find that mode a is in\\nstate\\n\\u2223\\u03b1e\\u2212i\\u03c4\\nthen modes b1, b2 and b3 will be projected to the entangled state\\n(|1\\u30093 |0\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |0\\u30093 |1\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |0\\u30093 |0\\u30092 |1\\u30091) , (15)\\nand the probability for obtaining this state is 3 |\\u03b2|2 /\\n1 + |\\u03b2|2\\n. On the other hand, If we find that\\nmode a is in state\\n\\u2223\\u03b1e\\u2212i2\\u03c4\\nthen modes b1, b2 and b3 will be projected to the entangled state\\n(|1\\u30093 |1\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |1\\u30093 |0\\u30092 |1\\u30091 + |0\\u30093 |1\\u30092 |1\\u30091) , (16)\\nand the probability for getting this state is 3 |\\u03b2|4 /\\n1 + |\\u03b2|2\\n. Equations (15) and (16) can be named\\nas 1-photon W state [8] and 2-photon W state, respectively.\\nFor the general case in which |\\u03b2\\u3009 is not very weak we use equation (8). In this case the interactions\\ntransform the states as follows:\\n|\\u03b2\\u30093 |\\u03b2\\u30092 |\\u03b2\\u30091 |\\u03b1\\u3009a = e\\n\\u22123|\\u03b2|2/2\\nl,m,n\\n\\u03b2l+m+n\\u221a\\nl!m!n!\\n|l\\u30093 |m\\u30092 |n\\u30091 |\\u03b1\\u3009a\\n\\u2192 e\\u22123|\\u03b2|\\nl,m,n\\n\\u03b2l+m+n\\u221a\\nl!m!n!\\n|l\\u30093 |m\\u30092 |n\\u30091\\n\\u03b1e\\u2212i(l+m+n)\\u03c4\\n. (17)\\nIf we find that mode a is in the state\\n\\u2223\\u03b1e\\u2212i(l+m+n)\\u03c4\\n\\u2223\\u03b1e\\u2212ik\\u03c4\\n(k = l+m+n = 1, 2, ...), then\\nmodes b1, b2 and b3 will be projected to the entangled state\\n(k \\u2212m\\u2212 n)!m!n!\\n|k \\u2212m\\u2212 n\\u30093 |m\\u30092 |n\\u30091 (k = 1, 2, ...). (18)\\nWe name this state as the 3-mode k-photon entangled state. The probability for getting this state\\nis exp(\\u22123 |\\u03b2|2)3\\n|\\u03b2|2k .The entanglement property of the states of Eq.(18) can be proved by using\\nfollowing entanglement criteria [7]\\nb+1 b2\\n> \\u3008Nb1Nb2\\u3009 and\\nb+2 b3\\n> \\u3008Nb2Nb3\\u3009 . (19)\\nFor the states (18), we can find\\nb+1 b2\\nb+2 b3\\nk2, and \\u3008Nb1Nb2\\u3009 = \\u3008Nb2Nb3\\u3009 = 19k (k \\u2212 1) .Therefore\\nthe entanglement condition (19) is satisfied, and the states (18) are indeed entangled states of three\\nmodes. For k = 1, equation (18) reduces to equation (15), and some other examples of the 3-mode\\nk-photon entangled state are as follows:\\n{(|2\\u30093 |0\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |0\\u30093 |2\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |0\\u30093 |0\\u30092 |2\\u30091)\\n2 (|1\\u30093 |1\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |1\\u30093 |0\\u30092 |1\\u30091 + |0\\u30093 |1\\u30092 |1\\u30091)} (k = 2) , (20)\\n{(|3\\u30093 |0\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |0\\u30093 |3\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |0\\u30093 |0\\u30092 |3\\u30091)\\n3 (|2\\u30093 |1\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |2\\u30093 |0\\u30092 |1\\u30091 + |1\\u30093 |2\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |1\\u30093 |0\\u30092 |2\\u30091 + |0\\u30093 |2\\u30092 |1\\u30091 + |0\\u30093 |1\\u30092 |2\\u30091)\\n6 |1\\u30093 |1\\u30092 |1\\u30091} (k = 3) . (21)\\nEquation (20) is a superposition of two 2-photon W states. While equation (21) is a superposition\\nof a 3-photon W state (the first line), a product state (the third line), and a state (the second line)\\nwhich can be expressed as\\n|1\\u3009j |0\\u3009k + |0\\u3009j |1\\u3009k\\n+ |1\\u3009i\\n|2\\u3009j |0\\u3009k + |0\\u3009j |2\\u3009k\\n+ |0\\u3009i\\n|2\\u3009j |1\\u3009k + |1\\u3009j |2\\u3009k\\n, (22)\\nwhere the subscripts i = 1,or 2, or 3,and j,k are the other two, respectively. We also note that in\\nthe superposition (20) the probability of getting the state (|1\\u30093 |1\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |1\\u30093 |0\\u30092 |1\\u30091 + |0\\u30093 |1\\u30092 |1\\u30091)\\nis larger than that of getting the state (|2\\u30093 |0\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |0\\u30093 |2\\u30092 |0\\u30091 + |0\\u30093 |0\\u30092 |2\\u30091). This shows again\\nthat the photons trend to distribute among different modes symmetrically.\\n5 Summary\\nIn summary, we have proposed a scheme for generating entangled states of light fields. This scheme\\nhas following advantages: First, the scheme only involves the cross-Kerr nonlinear interaction between\\ncoherent light-beams, followed by a homodyne detection. It is not necessary that the cross-Kerr\\nnonlinearity is very large, as long as the coherent light is bright enough. Therefore, this scheme is\\nwithin the reach of current technology. Second, in addition to the Bell states between two modes and\\nthe W states among three modes, plentiful new kinds of entangled states can be generated with this\\nscheme. We also found that in the generated entangled states, the photons have a trend to distribute\\namong different modes symmetrically. Finally, we would like to point out that the scheme can be\\nextend to generate the entangled states among more than three modes.\\nAcknowledgement This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of\\nChina under grant nos 60578055 and 10404007.\\nReferences\\n[1] N.A.Nielsen and I.L.Chuang,Quantum Computation and Quantum Information (Cambridge:\\nCambridge University Press, 2000 ); D.Bouwmeester, A.Ekert, and A.Zeilinger, The Physics of\\nQuantum Information (Berlin: Springer, 2000).\\n[2] U.Leonhardt,Measuring the Quantum state of light (Cambridge: Cambridge University\\nPress,1997); H.A.Bachor and T.C.Ralph,A Guide to Experiments in Quantum Optics(Weinheim:\\nWiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.KGaA, 2004).\\n[3] B.C.Sanders and G.J.Milburn, Phys.

transistors and organic light emitting diodes marius prelipceanu otilia sanda prelipceanu ovidiu gelu tudose sigurd schrader university of potsdam institute of physics condensed matter physics am neuen palais germany university of applied sciences wildau department of engineering physics wildau germany corresponding author mariusp rz uni potsdam de published in abstract book of icpam iasi romania june in the last years progress has been made in the field of organic electronics and in particular organic light emitting devices and organic field effect transistors in this case the study of localised levels in technologically relevant materials like oxadiazoles and quinoxalines is of fundamental importance several scientific tools enable to study localised levels in solids and among others the thermally stimulated techniques give the most direct evidence of their presence the present work is focused on theoretical and experimental study of localised levels in organic materials suitable for light emitting devices and field effect transistors by means of thermal techniques keywords thermally stimulated techniques localised levels organic materials light emitting devices led field effect transistors fet introduction the discussion about the presence of localised states and their density naturally leads to the question about the kind of traps we are dealing with in first approach we should distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic defects in the first type we should inscribe polymer end groups grain boundaries structural defects conformational disorder up to molecular groups with large permanent dipole moment that could increase the level of energetic disorder for the second type we should mention the chemical impurities somehow unavoidable in the synthesis of organic molecules we can further distinguish the kind of traps in function of their location interfacial or bulk or in term of energy deep traps or shallow traps also polarons could be seen in simplistic way like defects caused by an electron plus an induced lattice polarisation followed by lattice distortion traps are into the samples in great variety and in different proportion often despite the same preparation procedure for that reason sometimes their nature is difficult to investigate and the data must be handled with care in the studies of trapped states because of the above underlined variety of defects in solids the most successful approach is to start introducing single type of defect in well known system in controlled way experimental part in our work we focused on low molecular compounds as well as on polymers especially of two classes of materials oxadiazoles and quinoxalines both organic compounds are well know as electron transport materials in oleds ppqs see figure in general show very high solubility in variety of common organic solvents and according to literature they exhibit glass transition at quite high temperature the materials were deposited by spin coating on gold aluminium or silicon in different speed or concentration for the film optimisation the layer thickness was controlled by dektak techniques and ellypsometry the thermally stimulated luminescence tsl and thermally stimulated current tsc are powerful instruments in order to study de trapping and relaxation processes in organic materials tsl is contact less technique that allows to distinguish between deep and shallow trapping states the proposed mathematical model for the tsl enables to study trap levels and recombination centres inside the band gap the analytical solution of the rate equations allows two different de trapping regimes including or excluding subsequent re trapping effects the first order solution kinetic indicates that no re trapping phenomena are permitted the electron released from localised level recombines with hole in recombination centre and its re trapping probability before to recombine is negligible the second order equation deals with the opposite extreme case the phonon assisted release of an electron is followed by multiple re trapping in this second order kinetic regime the probability of released electron to get re trapped is very high the main factors governing both solutions are the energy depth of the traps calculated with respect to the conduction band edge and the frequency factor this second important factor in general indicates the attempt to escape frequency of electrons from the localised levels the mathematical model takes also into account the occurrence of distributions of localised levels in case of gaussian distribution of localised states meaningful parameter is the width of the distribution numerical simulations calculated with the proposed model show that while first order peak is characterised by an asymmetric peak shape with steep decreasing side the second order kinetic peaks are characterised by more symmetric shape the signal is smeared along the whole peak temperature range due to the re trapping effect figure poly phenylene bis phenylquinoxaline ppq ia the same theoretical description holds for both techniques tsl and tsc however tsc theory requires the presence of an extended conduction band during tsc experiment driving voltage is applied to the sample and the de trapped charges are extracted at the device contacts however the equations describing tsc peak are similar to equations describing tsl additionally it is possible to determine the density of the trapping states evaluating the area under tsc peak simultaneous tsl and tsc measurements give useful information about the localised states combining the best possibilities of both thermal techniques unambiguous information about trap depth density of states kinetics order and frequency factor can be extract making use of the full possibilities of the combined measurements in typical thermally stimulated process experiments sample is heated in controlled way and the current in case of tsc or the light emission in case of tsl or both simultaneously are monitored the effect appears only when an optical or electrical excitation takes place prior to the heating tsc in contrast to tsl requires the presence of good ohmic contacts in the following tsl experiment is described in more detail and the rate equations derived the sample in an equilibrium state at room temperature where all the shallow traps are empty is cooled down to low temperature then it is illuminated with electromagnetic radiation of certain energy the incident radiation excites the electrons from the valence band to the conduction band trough the gap in the case of prompt fluorescence the generated electrons recombine promptly otherwise they can form an electron hole pair followed by geminate recombination or by dissociation with subsequent trapping charge carriers can get trapped in localised levels that considering the random fluctuation of the potential in disordered materials are distributed in energy from statistical consideration the distribution type should be generally gaussian the thermal emission from traps at low temperature is negligibly small therefore the perturbed equilibrium created by the incident radiation resists for long time and the electrons are just stored in the localised levels temperature is then raised in controlled way electrons acquire energy and finally escape from the traps by means of phonon assisted jump and recombine with holes trough recombination centre where recombination occurs with subsequent photon emission by means of spectrally resolved tsl experiments it is possible to get information about recombination centres studying the wavelength of the emitted light as function of temperature and intensity the above described processes are illustrated in figure the illustrated scheme for thermoluminescence is simple but despite of its simplicity it can describe all fundamental features of thermoluminescence process following chen the electron exchange between the homo and lumo levels during the trap emptying can be described by the following three differential equations ann pnannn annannnpn here nh is the concentration of holes in the recombination centres nc is the concentration of electrons in the conduction band ar is the recombination coefficient for electrons in the conduction band with holes in the recombination centres is the concentration of electrons in traps is the function describing the concentration of electron traps at depth below the edge of the conduction band is the transition coefficient for electrons in the conduction band becoming trapped and is the same probability of thermal release of electrons from traps defined in equation which represents in fact their release rate equation describes the change of hole density nh in recombination centres versus time the recombination rate depends both from the concentration of free electrons nc and from the concentration of holes already present in the recombination centres trough probability coefficient ar that depends on the cross section and the thermal velocity of electrons an increase in these parameters results in an increase of the recombination probability equation describes the exchange of electrons between conduction band and traps the first term in the right hand side includes the probability for an electron to be trapped that probability like ar also depends on the thermal velocity of electrons and on the cross section of traps the second term on the right hand side is the de trapping term it is proportional to the concentration of trapped electron centre hole centre conduction band valence band recombination centre figure energy diagram describing the elementary process of the simple model for tsl electrons and to the boltzmann function equation the proportionality factor often called frequency factor or pre exponential factor should be when interpreted in terms of attempt to escape of an electron from the potential well in the order of magnitude of saturation effect for carrier release from traps caused by limited number of available states in the conduction band is neglected in this model in each moment the number of available states in conduction band is much higher than the released amount of electrons from the localised states equation describes the variation of electron density in the conduction band and essentially it takes into account the charge neutrality of the whole system the variation rate of electrons in the conduction band depends on electrons being released first term on the right hand side electrons being trapped second term and electrons that recombine third term electrons and holes in that model are generated at the same time geminate couples but they are not necessarily still bound saturation effects due to filled deeper traps or recombination centres that have already hole on them are not considered complex models have the disadvantage to introduce an increased number of parameters actually several combinations of too many parameters can generate the same shape of real glow curve making impossible to find most probable fit for that reason it is preferable to deal with reasonable simple model that involves few reliable parameters actually the proposed simple model can successfully describe the experimental glow curves but it is necessary to take also the energetic distribution of localised states into account in order to describe the complex behaviour of disordered systems like amorphous polymers or organic polycrystalline thin films in such case the total number of traps is represented by the following equation the traps do not have single activation energy but they are continuously energetically distributed deenn here can be in principle any kind of distribution but considering the statistical disorder in organic materials it should have gaussian shape in principle also the frequency factor should have the same energetic distribution in order to solve the system of differential equations equation regarding the time dependence of temperature should be add ttt in equation is the experimental constant heating rate it should be note that as long as is well knows function of the time the only real variable is the time for that reason it is very important experimentally to have perfect control of the temperature linearity results and discussion the main peak in figure has the maximum temperature at tm and the second of the roughly half the intensity at tm the peak at tm has symmetry factor very near to the typical value for second order kinetic this fact gives hint that in ppq ia an electron before recombination has high probability to get re trapped several times because of its hidden position the analysis of the minor peak of ppq ia appearing at tm is very difficult temperature temperature figure tsl of ppq ia figure tsl glow curve of ppq ia sample red line compared with the second order numerical simulation of the first peak green line figure shows the numerical fitting of the main tsl peak of ppq ia the fit is performed by means of second order equation characterised by gaussian distribution of traps while the high temperature side perfectly fits the glow curve the low temperature side do not follow the curve shape for that reason the numerical simulation is not completely satisfactory the distribution has width ev and the distribution maximum is at em ev the energy maximum em lies exactly in the middle of the integration limits ev and ev having the distribution in such case perfect gaussian shape the natural frequency of this peak can be estimated to be in the order of considering as is normal the recombination coefficient trapping coefficient ratio equal to and density of traps of cm the value of em derived by numerical analysis is far from the expected energy depth of trap calculated with the initial rise method however this mismatching can be explained considering the particular complexity of the peak that could result from the sum of at least two distributed peaks in effect the initial rise procedure reveals the activation energy of hidden peak at low temperature this is an important point to clarify because of the importance of the presence of shallow traps in materials suitable for plastic electronic applications shallow traps are at room temperature empty and they play crucial role in the electron transport property of organic materials for different thickness we obtain glow curves from figure temperature figure glow curve of ppq ia for nm we made tsc measurements for poly hexyle thiophene pht on sio treated and untreated in oxygen plasma the tsc experiment consisted of cooling to trap filling by light mercury lamp with bias voltage application of readout voltage heating with sec and measurement of detrapping current all measurements were carried out in vacuum mbar the traps were filled by creating carriers with band to band photoexcitation of the samples the light source was mercury lamp the thermally stimulated currents were measured by keithley electrometer the tsc and temperature data were stored in personal computer as described earlier in typical experiment the samples are cooled down to and kept at this temperature for min then they are illuminated through front electrode for minutes at bias voltage measurements were started after exposure to light and samples are then heated with constant rate sec from up to we measured and compared samples of pht on sio treated and untreated in oxygen plasma both experiments were performed under the same conditions the concentration of the traps was estimated using manfredotti et al the relation nt here is the quantity of charge released during tsc experiment and can be calculated from the area under the tsc peaks and are the area and the thickness of the sample respectively is the electronic charge and is the photoconductivity gain which equals to the number of electrons passing through the sample for each absorbed photon nt was calculated by assuming for that samples nm and samples have cm the trap is characterized by the temperature tm

observed difference between the trap concentrations in these two samples treated and untreated of two orders of magnitude conclusions thermal techniques are powerful tool in the to study of localised levels in inorganic and organic materials thermally stimulated luminescence thermally stimulated currents and thermally stimulated depolarisation currents allow when applied in synergy the details shallow of traps and deeper levels to be investigated they also permit to study in synergy with dielectric spectroscopy as polarisation and depolarisation effects the analysis of the thermograms emerging from the thermal techniques can be performed starting from the differential rate equations of the de trapping phenomena such an approach allowed by the computing power of the modern computers is not the most fruitful while the number of free variables involved in the numerical resolution of the rate differential equations is too high sometimes completely different sets of parameters can

of this work is submitted to astronomy and astrophysics introduction there is no doubt that galaxies suffer chemical enrichment during their lives see cid fernandes et al for recent systematic approach using large data base of galaxies from the sloan digital survey data release adelman mac carthy et al the main source of oxygen production has since long been identified as due to supernovae from massive stars type ii supernovae yet the exact process by which chemical enrichment proceeds is poorly known see review by scalo elmegreen ten years ago tenorio tagle hereafter proposed scenario in which the metal enhanced ejecta from supernovae follow long excursion in galactic haloes before falling down on the galaxies in the form of oxygen rich droplets in the present work the full version of which has been submitted to astronomy astrophysics stasin ska et al we suggest that the discrepancy between the oxygen abundances derived from optical recombination lines orls and from collisionally ex cited lines cels in hii regions see garc \\u0131a rojas et al and references therein might well be the signature of those oxygen rich droplets in fact tsamis et al and pe quignot tsamis already suggested that the orl cel discrepancy in hii regions is the result of inhomegeneities in the chemical composition in these objects our aim is to explicit the link between the orl cel

the highly metallic droplets thus show mixing at work stasin ska et al oxygen rich droplets and the enrichment of the ism figure sketch of the scenario after the last supernova has exploded the gas in the superbubble begins to cool down loci of higher densities cool down quicker due to sequence of fast repressurizing shocks this leads to the formation of metal rich cloudlets the cooling timescale is of the order of myr figure sketch of the scenario the now cold metal rich cloudlets fall unto the galactic disk they are further fragmented into metal rich droplets by raighleigh taylor instabilities this metal rich rain affects region whose extension is of the order of kiloparsecs much larger than the size of the initial hii region we find that if our scenario holds the recombination lines strongly overestimate the metallicities of the fully mixed hii regions the collisionally excited lines may also over estimate them although in much smaller proportion in absence of any recipe to correct for these biases we recommend to discard objects showing large adfs to probe the chemical evolution of galaxies stasin ska et al oxygen rich droplets and the enrichment of the ism figure sketch of the scenario when next generation of massive stars form they photoionize the surrounding interstellar medium including the metal rich droplets it is only after the droplets have been photoionized that their matter is intimately mixed with the matter from the ism and that proper chemical enrichment has occured the whole process since the explosion of the supernovae that provided fresh oxygen has taken at least myr to proceed further with this question of inhomogeneities one needs as many observa tional constraints as possible on the theoretical side one needs more

susceptibility the time evolution operator is exp exp ikn an bt exp i\\u03c4 an in which kt it can be named as the scaled interaction time or the nonlinear phase shift here is the length of the kerr medium and is the velocity of light in the kerr medium the cross kerr nonlinearity has following property \\u03b1e in\\u03c4 here and are the photon number state and the coherent state respectively entanglement between two modes now let us study the generation of the entangled states between two modes the scheme is shown in figure assume that mode is in coherent state mode is also in coherent state which is divided by the beam splitter bs into two beams and and both and are in coherent state we first consider the case of weak coherent state in this case we have where and are the vacuum state and one photon state respectively let mode interacts with mode and successively for simplicity we assume that both the scaled interaction times are thai is kt kt the interactions change the state as following way \\u03b1e i\\u03c4 \\u03b1e i\\u03c4 where the subscripts and denote modes and respectively we note that the internal product of coherent states satisfies \\u03b1e in\\u03c4 \\u03b1e sin in which we have taken into account the fact that in practice is small and therefore sin however if mode is bright enough so that then the two coherent states will be approximately orthogonal this condition can be easily satisfied in experiments and in following discussions we assume that it is satisfied in this case homodyne detection can distinguish different coherent states therefore when we find that mode is in the coherent state \\u03b1e i\\u03c4 then beam and beam will be projected into the entangled state and the probability for getting this entangled state is this state is one of bell states and special case of the noon states now let us consider the general situation in which beam and beam are normal coherent states in this situation exp the cross kerr interactions transform the state as follows \\u03b2m \\u03b2m \\u03b1e if the homedyne detection finds mode in the state \\u03b1e \\u03b1e ik\\u03c4 then mode and mode will be collapse into the entangled state since in this state the sum of photon numbers of the two modes is equal to we name this state as the mode photon entangled state the probability for getting this state is exp the entanglement property of the states expressed by eq can be proved by using following entanglement criteria nbnb where nb nb and are the photon number operator the photon annihilation operator and the photon creation operator of mode respectively for the states of equation we can find and nbnb therefore the entanglement condition is satisfied and the states are indeed entangled states for equation reduces to equation and some other examples of the mode photon entangled states are listed below equations and are new kinds of entangled states equation can be understood as superposition of noon state and product state while equation can be understood as superposition of noon state and noon like state we also note that in the superposition the probability of getting the state is larger than that of getting the state that is the photons trend to distribute between the two modes symmetrically the properties and applications of these new kinds of entangled states will be studied in the future entanglement among three modes we can extend the scheme above to generate the entanglement among three modes for this purpose we modify the scheme from figure to figure in which bs has the reflection transmission and bs has the reflection transmission so that the three beams and have the same strength and we assume all of them are in the coherent state we let mode in coherent state interacts with modes and successively and for simplicity we assume that all of the scaled interaction times are equal thai is for the situation in which is weak and can be expressed as in equation the interactions transform the states in the following way \\u03b1e i\\u03c4 \\u03b1e i\\u03c4 \\u03b1e i\\u03c4 as discussed above we assume that different coherent states in above equation are approximately orthogonal and we can use homodyne detection to distinguish them if we find that mode is in state \\u03b1e i\\u03c4 then modes and will be projected to the entangled state and the probability for obtaining this state is on the other hand if we find that mode is in state \\u03b1e i\\u03c4 then modes and will be projected to the entangled state and the probability for getting this state is equations and can be named as photon state and photon state respectively for the general case in which is not very weak we use equation in this case the interactions transform the states as follows \\u03b2l \\u03b2l \\u03b1e if we find that mode is in the state \\u03b1e \\u03b1e ik\\u03c4 then modes and will be projected to the entangled state we name this state as the mode photon entangled state the probability for getting this state is exp the entanglement property of the states of eq can be proved by using following entanglement criteria nbnb and nbnb for the states we can find and nbnb nbnb therefore the entanglement condition is satisfied and the states are indeed entangled states of three modes for equation reduces to equation and some other examples of the mode photon entangled state are as follows equation is superposition of two photon states while equation is superposition of photon state the first line product state the third line and state the second line which can be expressed as where the subscripts or or and are the other two respectively we also note that in the superposition the probability of getting the state is larger than that of getting the state this shows again that the photons trend to distribute among different modes symmetrically summary in summary we have proposed scheme for generating entangled states of light fields this scheme has following advantages first the scheme only involves the cross kerr nonlinear interaction between coherent light beams followed by homodyne detection it is not necessary that the cross kerr nonlinearity is very large as long as the coherent light is bright enough therefore this scheme is within the reach of current technology second in addition to the bell states between two modes and the states among three modes plentiful new kinds of entangled states can be generated with this scheme we also found that in the generated entangled states the photons have trend to distribute among different modes symmetrically finally we would like to point out that the scheme can be extend to generate the entangled states among more than three modes acknowledgement this work was supported by

an optical channel for example by measuring photons af ter beam splitter has erased their which path information as in figure remarkably recent experimental results demonstrated such an optical channel between ions in separate traps however results to date show that the raw entanglement generated in this way is liable to have significant noise well above fault tolerance thresholds thus it is important to ask can we exploit the mod est complexity within each local structure in order to distill the entanglement to higher fidelity originally entanglement distillation was intended for se cure quantum communication but the same protocols naturally carry over to distributed qc first noisy entanglement operation produces many noisy bell pairs between two locations which these protocols then con vert into fewer high fidelity bell pairs at each local site there must be certain number of qubits available one logical qubit that is directly involved in the computation and some num ber of ancilla qubits computation is performed by distilling high fidelity bell pair between two ancilla qubits and then us ing it to implement gate between two logical qubits in addi tion to allowing purification ancilla qubits protect the logical qubits against damage from probabilistic gates since these protocols emphasize implementing good fidelity gate we refer to them as gate based protocols

example level structures that would be suitable for the ancilla qubit the level has only one logical state that optically couples to an excited state the level structure has both levels coupling to common excited state however the two transitions are distinguishable by either frequency or polarization tillation of graph states is akin to error correction as it con sists in repeated measurement of the stabilizers that describe the graph state in virtue of this feature we refer to these as stabilizer based protocols the first such protocol uses noisy copies of graph state and post selects upon detection of single error further proposals cast aside the need for post selection at the cost of stricter error threshold above which distillation is possible these proposals use combination of noisy copies of the graph state and highly pu rified ghz states because of the size of the entangled states in the ancilla space iterating these distillation protocols may take longer than for gate based protocols significant tem poral overhead will occur when the entangling operation has high failure rate building large entangled states in the an url mailto earl campbell materials ox ac uk cilla space also restricts the class of employable entangling operations excluding entangling protocols that only produce bell pairs of course provided we have enough local qubits to provide ancillas for our ancillas these disadvantages are easily nullified however many systems which are poten tially well suited for distributed qc may be very limited in the number of qubits they can embody by blending ideas from the gate based and stabilizer proto cols this paper proposes an entanglement distillation protocol which performs rapidly whilst requiring fewer ancillas than previous protocols the bulk of this paper shows that one an cilla is sufficient to distil errors from dephasing noise we then extend the protocol to cover depolarizing noise as with other schemes this requires an additional ancilla which we use to reduce the depolarizing noise to dephasing noise like gate based protocols we build up graph state edge by edge with ancillas never building entangled states larger than bell pairs however as with stabilizer based protocols our pro posal repeatedly makes stabilizer measurements directly onto the qubits constituting the graph state ancillas must typically be optically active such as in an or level configuration see fig qubits are labelled ax and lx for ancilla and logical qubit respectively at local site first our analysis will focus on the case when the noisy entanglement channel is dominated by one type of pauli error which may be very severe without loss of generality we describe the channel as being affected by phase noise such that two ancillas and can be put in the mixed state \\u03c1a \\u03b5za za where za is the pauli phase flip operator acting on either or and if the dominant noise is different pauli error or different bell pairs are pro duced then local rotations can always bring the state into the form of equation furthermore only single error is pos sible as this bell state is invariant under the bilateral zaza rotation scenarios where such noise model may arise in clude parity based entangling operations that possess degree of robustness against bit flip errors after producing noisy entanglement between two ancillas the entanglement is pumped down to the logical qubits result ing in quantum operation on the logical qubits the target perfect entangling operation we aim to eventually achieve is either of the parity projections which act on the logical qubits and and have an ad ditional normalization factor of that simplifies later expres sions the only assumption we make about the initial state of the logical qubits is that they are part of graph state in the constructive definition such that they have equal magni tude in both parity subspaces where denotes the graph state of all the logical qubits both and allow arbitary graph growth and which projection we eventually obtain is unimportant as differ only by lo cal rotations we will see that entanglement distillation results from repetition of an entanglement transfer procedure fig the sequence of operations required to pump entanglement down to two logical qubits and shown in the graph state no tation ancillas are prepared in the state and the logical qubits are part of some larger graph state an entan gling operation is performed between the ancillas with the possibil ity of noise is applied to ancilla at both local sites control operations are performed between ancilla and logical qubit ancilla is measured in the basis ancilla is measured in the basis the possibility of error is tracked by using ze where tracks an error and tracks the er rorless state the measurement outcome is represented by where for measurement and otherwise the dotted line between the logical qubits represents projection operator between the logical qubits where the sign is equal to each round of our protocol is an entanglement pumping procedure described graphically in fig every round of purification begins with performing noisy entangling opera tion between two ancillas and this operation may be probabilistic provided that success is heralded in which case it is repeated until successful next series of local opera tions must be performed first apply bit flip then hadamard to one ancilla say and then two control operations be tween each ancilla and its logical qubit the resulting state is graph state with the possibility of error on then measure in the basis correcting for any by product giving the state described by fig finally is measured in the basis when no error was present this measurement performs parity check on the logical qubits and that is we measure the observable zlzl on the first round of pumping the odd and even parity outcomes will occur with probability accounting for the possibility of error causes noisy parity measurement or quantum operation where and is for mea surement outcome and for if we repeat the entanglement pumping procedure times then we will get series of measurements results mn concatenating the mapping for each mea surement result we get back an operation of the same form but with mi the core of our proposal is that we continue to purify the qubits until reaches some value fig the evolution of against the number of rounds of entan glement pumping the state evolves as biased random walk in the weighting of probabilities at some point is such that there is probability for increasing the magnitude of where is defined in equation the red dashed lines represent the halting lines for and in this example note that the paths to the halting line occur at for non negative integer at which point we halt the procedure is chosen such that it corresponds to target fidelity ft where the fidelity is simply in contrast to previous gate based protocols our protocol is not post selective nps analogous post selecting protocols ps using an equivalent entangling pumping procedure to eliminate phase errors have already been proposed the essential difference for ps is that it resets upon any measure ment outcome mx that differs from the first measurement outcome reset consists in measuring out the qubits be ing distilled bringing them back to benefits of nps are two fold since purification is never restarted it is safe to operate directly on the logical qubits hence we eliminate the need for an additional ancilla that exists in ps protocols ii the probability of success within rounds is never less than for ps indeed we shall show that nps significantly out performs ps in this regard point in favour of ps is that if can freely use multiple ancillas then ps may achieve higher asymptotic limit of fidelity due to the effect of errors in local operations however we shall see that nps can still attain fidelities within fault tolerance thresholds returning to our consideration of the evolution of in our protocol it is clear that at each purification step can either increase or decrease by hence the evolution bears similarities to random walk illustrated by fig it differs from random walk in two regards it halts when it reaches ii the probabilities are the biased when the bias increases the chance of walking in the direction of larger which occurs with probability \\u03b1d \\u03b5\\u03b1 \\u03b1d where on the face of it it seems that the probability of walking to state in steps is dependent upon which fig comparison of the rapidity of our proposal versus post selection protocol with target fidelity ft the three plots represent different values for the error rate and hence require different value of shown in key on each plot we show the probability of success against the number of rounds for both the protocol nps blue and ps orange the yield for nps and ps ynps and yps is given on each plot notice that for nps the prob ability of success increases in steps this is explained by figure which shows that successful paths are separated by time steps path is taken however the probability of kink in the path increasing and subsequently decreasing is independent of and is pd pd hence each path occurs with probability ppath the total probability of walking to is the product of ppath with the number of paths to that position we have calculated the total probability of success after rounds by summing over all the different ways of reaching the halting line for comparison we performed the analogous calculation for an otherwise equivalent ps protocol figure shows ps and nps protocols for target fidelity of ft with each plot being for different error rate note that for higher error rate or higher target fidelity the width of the random walk is wider larger in this regime the superiority of nps increases as more entanglement can be lost upon post selection conversely when the protocols are effectively identical as stepping back will take the walk to the origin protocol yield is the expected ratio of distilled bell pairs to used noisy bell pairs since each time step uses bell pair the yield of protocol is with some values given in fig since nps is faster protocol than ps it also has superior yield for this idealized error model we can asymptotically ap proach unit fidelity however it is important to consider how other errors limit the maximum attainable fidelity for sim plicity we take an aggressive error model where if single error occurs once then the overall entangling gate has fidelity zero we use to denote the probability per time step that an error occurs where these errors can result from either faulty fig logarithmic plot of the expected infidelity when additional error sources affect our distillation protocol the plot is function of the probability of phase error occurring in the long range entangling operation each curve is different value of the probability per distillation round that some other error oc curs the blue cross marks an example discussed in the text where the dephased bell pairs are obtained by prior distillation on raw de polarized bell pairs local operations or noise in the entanglement channel that is orthogonal to the distilled dominant noise furthermore we approximate the chance of an error after rounds by its up per bound \\u03b7t once we reach the fidelity will depend on the number of time steps taken therefore we calculate the expectation of the fidelity figure shows how the expected infidelity varies with and since the optimal choice of changes with this produces inverted humps along the curves which are more pronounced for small on all curves the behaviour is roughly the same we can characterize the performance by noting that when the domi nant error rate is and the probability of other error sources is then the protocol brings all error probabili ties to order given that relevant fault tolerance strategies can handle noise of order the single ancilla dis tillation may suffice when is of order if the orthogonal errors are too large then an additional an cilla is required using the two ancillas bit errors are first distilled away by post selective protocol such as in orthogonal errors are at their most extreme when the noise is depolarizing producing werner states of fidelity as an example we consider the distillation of werner states of rigorous analysis is provided in appendix five rounds of distillation reduces the orthogonal errors to after which the phase noise has accumulated to we have not gained fidelity but we have mapped all noise into phase noise these dephased bell pairs are used in our primary distillation protocol and are distilled to this result is marked on fig where is taken to equal the remaining non phase errors as final re mark note that if we create ghz states among ancillas rather than bell pairs then our strategy can be combined with the band aid protocol of increasing tolerance of imperfect local operations in conclusion using fewer ancillas than previous pro posals an otherwise intolerably large error is rapidly re duced below error correction thresholds for de phasing depolarizing noise models the protocol needs only one two ancillas respectively the author thanks simon ben jamin joseph fitzsimons pieter kok and dan browne for useful

linguistics max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology deutscher platz leipzig germany abstract simulations of physicists for the competition between adult languages since are reviewed how many languages are spoken by how many people how many languages are contained in various language fam ilies how do language similarities decay with geographical distance and what effects do natural boundaries have new simulations of bilinguality are given in an appendix introduction while the emergence and learning of human languages has been simulated since decades on computers and while later economics nobel laureate also contributed to linguistics long ago the competition between existing languages of adults is more recent research trend where physicists have tried to play major role it follows the principle of survival of the fittest as known from darwinian evolution in biology and indeed many of the tech niques have been borrowed from simulational biology this emphasis from physics on the competition of existing languages for adult humans started with abrams and strogatz and was then followed by at least six groups independently more recently of course reviews and conferences brought them together and others followed them today about different languages as defined by linguists are spoken and about every ten days one of them dies out on the other hand the split of latin into different languages spoken from portugal to romania is well documented in statistical physics we can describe and explain the pressure which air molecules of known density and temperature exert on the walls but we can not predict were one given molecule will be one second from now similarly the application of statistical physics tools to linguistics may describe the ensemble of the seven thousand presently existing languages url size distribution of language sizes from grimes ethnologue and exp ln size figure empirical variation of the number ns of languages spoken by people each for better presentation the language sizes are binned in powers of two data from ethnologue as plotted in the parabola corresponds to log normal distribution we see deviations from it for the smallest sizes but not the extinction of one given language in one given region on earth figure shows how many languages exist today as function of the number of speakers of that language statistical theory of language competition thus first of all should try to reproduce such results in order to validate the model if if fails to describe this fact why should one trust it at all or as stated by linguist yang on page of it is time for the ancient field of linguistics to join the quantitative world of modern science this review starts with our own model for numerous languages in section followed by review of the alternative model of viviane de oliveira and coworkers then we review more shortly the many other models which at present do not allow the simulation of thousands of different languages schulze model definition our own simulations also called the schulze model characterise each lan guage or grammar by independent features each of which can take one of different values the binary case allows the storage in bit strings three basic mechanisms connected with probabilities and are common to all variants with probability at each iteration and for each feature this feature is changed or mutated in biological language this change is random or not depending on process ii ii with probability the mutation change under is not random but instead transfers the value of this feature from another person in the popu lation this transfer is called diffusion by linguists with probability the change is random iii with probability also has been used instead somebody discards the mother language and takes over the whole language all features from another person in the population here is the fraction of people speaking the old language this flight is called shift by linguists several variants are possible one can use one joint population where everybody can meet everybody for transfer and shift or we put people onto square lattice or more complicated network where diffusion and or shift are possible only from randomly selected neighbour people may migrate on this lattice which physicists would call diffusion the population can be fixed meaning that at every iteration all adults are replaced by their children or it can grow by suitable birth and death process in this case the shifting probability can include also factor proportional to the population if one dislikes to have three free parameters one may set without much loss in results for the number of features from to were used in simulations real languages contain many thousands of words for everyday use and thus one should identify one feature rather with an independent grammatical element like the order of subject object and verb in sentence than with word for real languages was estimated as about or about to such choices and the word atlas of language structures lists features with up to values these grammar sizes thus correspond roughly to what has been simulated according to the rate of change in normal linguistic typological features excluding few extraordinarily unstable ones is per years results if we start with everybody speaking one language or with just one eve then at low this language still dominates and is spoken by more than half of the total population with the remaining people speaking minor and short lived variant of this dominating language at high on the other hand the whole population soon fragments into many languages roughly such that everybody selects nearly randomly one of the qf possible languages this corresponds to the biblical story of the tower of babel we thus have dominance for small and fragmentation for large with first order phase transition or jump at some threshold value which depends on the other parameters and details of the model if instead we start with everybody speaking randomly selected lan guage then for high this situation remains for low however after some time one language by random accidents happens to grow to sufficiently large size such that it then grows rapidly to be spoken by more than half of the population thus transition from initial fragmentation to final dom inance happens in fig the threshold value is different from the one for the opposite direction from dominance to fragmentation we have hysteresis as is common for first order transitions fig empirically this transition to one dominating language was observed on the american continent within the last five centuries two thirds of the native brazilian languages have died out and in the last half century we observed the rise of english in physics research publications while years ago physicist bose sent from india his paper to einstein in order to have it translated from english to german which lead to bose einstein condensation after world war ii physics re search was usually published in english first in japan since the in west germany decade later in france since the in russia finally china has witnessed surge in physics papers written in english since the time needed to go from fragmentation to dominance increases roughly logarithmically with population size at least in the binary case with out lattice thus mathematical solution for an infinite population might never get this transition in other words proper models should be agent based with individuals acting on their own one should not average over size of largest language for people mutations per person figure variation with time of the number of people speaking the most widespread language for various population sizes the larger the population is the longer is the time until the transition from fragmentation to dominance takes place from the whole population using differential equation for the concentrations such simulations have been standard in computational physics for half century monte carlo and molecular dynamics while mean field approximations average over many individuals and can give somewhat or completely wrong results the transition from fragmentation to dominance may require shift probability instead of the language size distribution to be compared with fig is shown in fig to get it we looked at non equilibrium results and introduced ran dom multiplicative noise since otherwise the language sizes were too small and their distribution too irregular fig avoids these tricks and instead places the people on directed scale free network discussed below no lattice or other spatial structure was employed in the above simula tions on lattice one can look at language geography north and south of the alps different languages are spoken and the same sepa ration is made by the english channel genetic and linguistic boundaries in europe mostly coincide and about two thirds of them agree with natural boundaries like mountain chain or sea we simulated this effect on population in millions critical mutation rate no transfer initially one top or initially many random languages bottom figure dependence of the mutation threshold for the phase transition on the population size upper data from dominance to fragmentation lower data from fragmentation to dominance above the curves we arrive at frag mentation below at dominance from lattice with contact only between nearest neighbours and horizontal barrier separating the upper from the lower half the shift from small to large language happens across the barrier only with small crossing probability for one thus has two completely separated halves of the lattice and trivially the languages which evolve as dominating are different on both sides of the border with the border has no effect and only one language dominates fig shows how often for small but finite two separate dominating languages may coexist already quite small suffice particularly for large lattices to unify the two regions into only one with the same language dominating on both sides fig employed directed baraba si albert scale free network these networks are grown from small fully connected core such that each new network member selects already existing members as teachers the more people have selected certain teacher before the higher is the probability that this teacher will again be selected information only flows from the teacher to the person who selected this teacher not in the opposite direction number of speakers two runs of million fragmented start mutation rate per bit string or number of speakers million sq figure language size distribution ns top without lattice with random multiplicative noise not in equilibrium bottom on scale free network in equilibrium crossing rate samples right line left line figure fraction of cases when semi permeable barrier allowed two different languages to dominate on its two sides in the schulze model viviane model definition the model of viviane de oliveira et al has become known as the viviane model following the brazilian tradition of how to call people it simulates the colonisation of an uninhabited continent by people each site of an square lattice can later be populated by cj people this carrying capacity cj is selected randomly between and some initially only one site is occupied by ci people then at each time step one randomly selected empty lattice neighbour of occupied sites becomes occupied with probability cj by cj people thus after some time the whole lattice becomes occupied and the simulation stops in contrast to the schulze model the viviane model is growth process and not one eventually fluctuating about some equilibrium languages have no internal structure and are simply numbered with being the number of the language spoken on the originally occupied site all people within one lattice site speak the same language first if new site has been colonized the language spoken there is taken from one of the occupied neighbours proportional to the fitness fk of that neighbour site this fitness is the total number of people speaking anywhere in the lattice the language of except that it is bounded from above by maximum fitness mk fixed randomly between and some mmax second mutations language change are made with probability fj on the freshly occupied site only from the selected language of neighbour mutation means that new language is created which gets new number not used previously in this way the flight shift from small language and the mutations which were two separate processes in the schulze model are combined into one process and this process also is transfer diffusion process which in the schulze model was dealt with separately thus we have here only one free parameter the mutation coefficient instead of three parameters in the schulze model variants allow mutations also later after site is occupied or language is characterised by string of bits in the schulze notation and only different bit strings count as different languages or the capacities ck are not homogeneously distributed between and but more often small than large with frequency proportional to cj as long as it is not larger than the maximum lot of computer time then is saved if after the occupation of the new sites one selects two of its occupied neighbours and takes the language from the one with the bigger capacity if only one neighbour is occupied then its language is taken over results in contrast to the schulze model the viviane model gives languages spoken by people if sufficiently large lattice is used the language size distri bution ns has maximum at moderately small language sizes however instead of round parabola as in fig the log log plot of ns versus gives two straight lines meeting at the maximum that means one power law for small where ns increases with and another power law for large where ns decreases with so not everything is solved yet crucial progress was made by paulo murilo de oliveira not the same family as viviane de oliveira who introduced the above mentioned modifi cations languages grammars are characterized by bit strings of length and count as different only when their bit strings differ the carrying capacities are selected with probability and the newly colonized site gets the fitter language of two previously occupied neighbours number of speakers languages million people figure variation of the number ns of languages spoken by people each in the viviane model as modified and published in now the distribution is roughly log normal fig with enhancement for very small sizes the total population and the total number of languages can be made close to the present reality the maximum of the parabola in double logarithmic plot with binning by factors of two in is near while the largest language is spoken by people similar to mandarin chinese fig shows for both the modified viviane model and the schulze lattice model that languages in general are less similar to each other if they are widely separated geographically in agreement with reality note the difference in scales one lattice constant distance between nearest neigh bours corresponds to about one kilometer in the viviane model and kilometers in the schulze model if fig is compared to reality also the classification of different languages into one family like the indo european languages has been simulated with moderate success following the history of the mutations during the colonisation language tree like can be constructed in the unmodified version fig in one can imagine that this is latin splitting up into romanian italian spanish and french with spanish then splitting into castellan galego and catalan and catalan mutating further into mallorquin many small branches were omitted for clarity more quantitative information is obtained from the modified bit geographical distance in modified viviane model line random differences geographical distance schulze model figure language differences in arbitrary units as function of geographical distance in the viviane model top and the schulze model bottom the horizontal line corresponds to completely uncorrelated lan guages in the bottom part and correspond to start with fragmentation and with dominance from string version the mutated language on newly occupied site starts new family if it differs in two or more bits from the bit string characterising the historically first language of the old family the size distribution of language families in fig agrees in its central part with the empirically observed exponent and is independent of the length or of the bit strings for the viviane model and independent of the population size for the schulze model number of languages sq bits number of families million sq figure number of families as function of the number of different lan guages in this family top modified viviane model for various lengths of the bit strings bottom schulze model with on directed baraba si albert scale free network for various population sizes other models years before physicists invaded en masse the field of linguistics nettle already wrote down differential equation for the number of languages dl dt where time is measured in millennia for long times only one language mathematically zero languages will remain however that time lies far in the future more detailed splitting mechanism was introduced by novotny and drozd for the emergence of new languages from one mother lan guage and gave log normal distribution of language sizes in agreement with reality except presumably at the smallest sizes in the same spirit of looking at languages as whole ignoring the individuals are the very re cent models of tuncay who coupled splitting mechanism with random multiplicative noise in the size of the growing population plus an extinction probability and found power law decay or log normal size distribution for the simulated languages depending on parameters he also checked the lifetimes of the simulated languages an early attempt to apply the ising model of statistical physics to linguistics had little success numerous coupled differential equations were studied by scientists coming from theoretical chemistry mathematics and computer science for the purpose of language learning by children they have been applied also to the competition of up to languages of adults but since the original authors have to our knowledge not followed this re interpretation of their learning model we now refer to for details and results it was the population dynamics of abrams and strogatz which started the avalanche of physics papers on language competition they assume two languages and spoken by the fractions and of fixed population with time dependence dx dt yxas xya with status or prestige variable which is close to one if has high prestige and close to zero for low prestige of the neutral case is the exponent was fitted to some empirical data of how minority languages decay in size if is replaced by unity we arrive at the logistic equation of verhulst from the th century which was applied to languages by shen in abrams strogatz model for and bottom to top unsymmetric figure abrams strogatz model fraction of people speaking language versus time for an initial concentration of only ten percent and various prestige values of this language for this language finally wins over the other language from fig shows the resulting if is spoken initially by minority of ten percent only then for low neutral or slightly higher status of its language the fraction decays further towards zero but for higher status like it finally wins over and is spoken by everybody not shown this may correspond to the influence of colonial power indeed in france today most people speak french as result of the roman conquest of more than two millennia ago and in brazil many of the native languages have become extinct in the last five centuries since the portuguese arrived there this abrams strogatz approach was soon generalized to lattice by pa triarca and lepa nnen and later to populations with bilingual speakers coexistence of the two languages as well simulations based on individuals such agent based simulations were also made by kosmidis et al who gave each person string of bits the first belonged to one language the last to another language in this way they were able to simulate people speaking more of less correctly one or two languages one could also interpret their model as one for english which is mixture of german anglo saxon and french words due to the conquest of england by the normans in finally schwa mmle also used bit strings but to describe biological ageing through the penna model the child can learn the languasge from the mother the father or both thus also allowing for bilinguals this model allowed to simulate that languages are learned easier in youth than at old age in this way it builds bridge between language competition and language learning how physics may inform linguistics prospects for future research as the research described above has progressed larger design has become apparent which consists in an empirical side looking for quantitative distribu tions involving languages and development of models simulating similar quantitive distributions the hope is that as more and more quantifi able relations in and among languages are discovered and simulation models are developed which can adequately replicate these distributions the simu lation models will of necessity become more and more adequate as models of actual languages and could therefore be employed for purposes beyond the ones for which they were designed for instance the revised viviane model which was designed to capture the distribution of speaker popula tions and the population of languages within families could potentially be employed for investigating absolute rates of language change an issue with which linguists are very much concerned inasmuch as knowledge of how fast languages change could provide us with way to date prehis toric events involving people speaking given reconstructed languages thus strand of research where linguists and physicists can and will continue to cooperate is the search for quantifiable distributions on the one hand and the fine tuning of models which can adequately simulate an increasing range of such distributions apart from some exceptions most work on language compe tition has assumed monolingual speakers since most of the world pop ulation is bi or multilingual this is clearly not adequate language shift will normally involve transitional bilingualism or bilingualism may persist for centuries without the majority language necessarily replacing minority languages diglossia the use of different languages for different pur poses may help sustain bilingualism current models can be extended to investigate under which conditions bilingualism may persist or get reduced to monolingualism different kinds of situations can be modelled such as the replacement of certain but not all languages within the domain of the roman empire the development of so called linguistic areas where several languages share number of features the balkans india mesoamer ica multilingualism caused by linguistic exogamy the northwest amazon region the shift from one to another lingua franca with retention of minority languages mayan immigrants in urban united states shifting from spanish to english but retaining mayan languages etc and may be applied to sit uations where prehistoric interaction has left linguistic traces but where the nature of the interaction is unknown the sharing of linguistic features around the entire coast of the pacific ocean in the appendix we provide preview of the extension of the schulze model to bilingualism an area where physicists may wish to try out their hands more is that of language change simulations may help linguists come to terms with realities that are accessible through empirical research only in small fragments lan guages develop and change through the interaction of multitudes of agents using large lexical inventories and complex grammars the kinds of regu larities that linguist can identify such as the regularity of sound changes or directed paths of grammaticalization roughly the process whereby sep arate words become part of the morphology are mostly accessible only to retrospective view trough the comparison of language stages dozens or hundreds of years apart what lies between is flux whose behavior is not easy to understand th century historical linguists with their focus on regular sound changes lived in universe of clean equations such as latin english as in pater father the advent of th century soci olinguistics with its focus on the social mechanisms behind sound changes complicated the picture much like the picture gets complicated when one moves from clean newtonian physics to modern statistical physics which tries to model the actual behavior and interaction of entities nevertheless unlike physicists linguists working on the way that languages change have taken little recourse to simulations that might help them understand the complexity of how language change or shift percolates within community for instance leading sociolinguist has argued that networks constituted chiefly of strong ties function as mechanism to support minority languages resisting institutional pressures to language shift but when these networks weaken language shift is likely to take place in this hypoth esis is based on just few case studies and such case studies are one the one hand extremely costly and on the other can not even begin to cover the multitute of different situations that actually obtains in addition to the strength of network ties other important parameters are presumably the size of the group speaking the minority language geography prestige of one as opposed to the other language economic gain involved in shifting language age and gender determined mobility and maybe more the behaviors of such parameters can be investigated in simulations for geography see finally more works needs to be done towards the integration of the mod elling of language competition by physicists reviewed here and the modelling of language evolution by computational linguists while physicists have been adept in modelling the interaction among agents but have operated with languages represented only by numbers or bit strings computational linguists offer elaborate grammar models with more com plex models of the interior structure of languages carried by agents research need not be limited to focus on language competition but could be ex tended to issues of language structure itself appendix bilingualism several authors studied the possibility that people speak more than one lan guage and we do here the same for the schulze model on the square lattice with features of different values using only interactions to nearest neighbours for this purpose we modify the switch process before languages spoken by fraction of the four neighbours were dropped in favour of the language of randomly selected neighbour with probability now we do this at lattice site only if none of the four neighbours of speaks the mother language of site then with probability we replace the mother language of by the mother language of randomly selected neighbour otherwise for with the above probability site learns as an additional foreign language randomly selected foreign or mother language of randomly selected neighbour if in the latter case site has already learned foreign language before then this old foreign language is replaced by the new foreign language leading mother and foreign sq languages leaders with and without sq bilinguals figure largest and second largest languages in the schulze lattice at in lattice without migration part includes bilinguals part compares only the mother languages with and without bilinguals as but with forgetting and migration migration left to right figure part as fig but including migration probability of and site dependent forgetting probability between zero and on lattice part shows the drastic speed up of dominance if the migration probability is enhanced these are the learning and replacement events if everybody can speak at most two languages if instead the number of languages for each person is restricted by an overall upper limit then for the last learned foreign language is replaced by the newly selected neighbour language if this upper limit is set equal to one we go back to the model of monolingual speakers in all cases is the fraction of neighbours of speaking as their mother tongue the mother language of site for language diffusion we took throughout and for language change mostly thus one iteration may correspond to about one human generation we start with fragmented distribution of mother languages and no foreign languageas except that one particular language is spoken initially by ten percent of the people randomly spread over the lattice then we check if this lingua franca finally after at most iterations is spoken by about everybody transition from fragmentation to dominance of initially favoured language if another language dominated we count this case as fragmentation for ten lattices this transition happened up to if bilin guality is allowed while for monolinguals it happens up to the larger chang ing rate bilinguality makes dominance of one language less stable against continuous changes see also for instead of this limit shifts from to while for it is about fig shows for lattices the time dependence of the fraction of people speaking the largest and the second largest language separately for mother tongue and foreign languages the comparison for the case without bilinguals is restricted to the mother language and shows that dominance is reached faster without bilinguals in these simulations after short time everybody speaks two languages and if up to ten languages are allowed then again after short time every body speaks ten languages this is nice but unrealistic in order to take into account that people forget again foreign languages which were learned but not used or give up learning foreign language when the need for it dissipates we assume that at every time step each speaker more precisely each lattice site may give up the last learned foreign language if none of the neighbours at that time speaks this language this forgetting happens with probability between zero and five percent fixed for each site randomly and independently at the beginning in addition we included migration via exchanging locations speaker or family exchanges residence with randomly selected neighbour and both carry their languages with them this happens at each iteration with probability physicists call the diffusion constant fig shows that ap preciable migration can drastically speed up the growth of the lingua franca from having an initial advantage of being spoken by ten percent of the pop ulation to being dominant references url wang minett trans philological soc selten und pool in selten hg game

      \"subfactors and hadamard matrices wes camp and remus nicoara abstract to any complex hadamard matrix one associates spin model commuting square and therefore hyperfinite subfactor the stan dard invariant of this subfactor captures certain group like symmetries of to gain some insight we compute the first few relative commutants of such subfactors for hadamard matrices of small dimensions also we show that subfactors arising from dita type matrices have intermediate subfac tors and thus their standard invariants have some extra structure besides the jones projections introduction complex hadamard matrix is matrix mn having all entries of absolute value and all rows mutually orthogonal equivalently is unitary matrix with all entries of the same absolute value for example the fourier matrix fn ij \\u03c0i is hadamard matrix in the recent years complex hadamard matrices have found applications in various topics of mathematics and physics such as quantum information theory error correcting codes cyclic roots spectral sets and fuglede con jecture general classification of real or complex hadamard matrices is not available catalogue of most known complex hadamard matrices can be found in tz the complete classification is known for and for self adjoint matrices of order ben the connection between hadamard matrices and von neumann algebras arose from an observation of popa po unitary matrix is of the form hadamard matrix if and only if the algebra of diagonal matrices dn is orthogonal onto udnu with respect to the inner product given by the trace on mn equivalently the square of inclusions dn mn udnu is commuting square in the sense of po po here denotes the trace on mn normalized such that url wes camp and remus nicoara such commuting squares are called spin models the name coming from sta tistical mechanical considerations see js by iterating jones basic con struction one can construct hyperfinite index subfactor from see for instance js the subfactor associated to can be used to capture some of the symmetries of and thus to classify to certain extent see bhj jo ban let be an inclusion of ii factors of finite index and let be the tower of factors constructed by iterating jones basic construction see jo where denote the jones projections the standard invariant gn is then defined as the trace preserving isomorphism class of the following sequence of commuting squares of inclusions of finite dimensional algebras the jones projections en are always contained in mn if the index of the subfactor is at least they generate the temperley lieb algebra of order denoted tln in lot of situations the relative commutant mn has some interesting extra structure besides tln for instance the five non equivalent real hadamard matrices of order yield different dimen sions for the second relative commutant and thus are classified by these dimensions bhj in this paper we investigate the relation between hadamard matrices and their subfactors we look at hadamard matrices of small dimensions or of special types the paper is organized as follows in the first section we recall in our present framework several results of jo js regarding computations of standard invariants for spin models in section we study the subfactors associated to hadamard matrices of dita type these are matrices that arise from construction of di which is generalization of construction of haagerup most known parametric families of hadamard matrices are of dita type we show that the associated subfactors have intermediate subfactors in the last section we present list of computations of the second and third relative commutants for complex hadamard matrices of small dimensions we make several remarks and conjectures regarding the structure of the standard invariant most of the computations included were done using computers with the help of the mathematica and gap softwares we would like to thank teodor banica kyle beauchamp and dietmar bisch for fruitful discussions and correspondence wes camp was supported in part subfactors and hadamard matrices by nsf under grant no dms reu grant and remus nicoara was supported in part by nsf under grant no dms subfactors associated to hadamard matrices let be complex hadamard matrix and let is unitary matrix with all entries of the same absolute value one associates to the square of inclusions dn mn udnu where dn is the algebra of diagonal matrices and is the trace onmn normalized such that since is hadamard matrix is commuting square in the sense of po po edneudnu ec the notation ea refers to the invariant conditional expectation from mn onto the subalgebra recall that two complex hadamard matrices are said to be equivalent if there exist unitary diagonal matrices and permutation matrices such that pdhdp it is easy to see that are equivalent if and only if are isomorphic as commuting squares conjugate by unitary from mn we denote by ct the commuting square obtained by flipping the upper left and lower right corners of udnu mn dn we have ct ad thus ct and are isomorphic as commuting squares if and only if are equivalent as hadamard matrices we now recall the construction of subfactor from commuting square by iterating jones basic construction jo one obtains from ct tower of commuting squares of finite dimensional algebras udnu mn dn together with the extension of the trace which we will still denote by and jones projections gi yi wes camp and remus nicoara let mh be the weak closure of ixi with respect to the trace and let nh be the weak closure of iyi nh mh are hyperfinite ii factors and the trace extends continuously to the trace of mh which we will still denote by it is well known that nh mh is subfactor of index which we will call the subfactor associated to the hadamard matrix the standard invariant of nh mh can be expressed in terms of commu tants of finite dimensional algebras by using ocneanu compactness argument in js consider the basic construction for the commuting square dn mn udnu ocneanu compactness theorem asserts that the first row of the standard invariant of nh mh is the row of inclusions udnu more precisely if nh mh mh mh is the jones tower obtained from iterating the basic construction for the inclu sion nh mh then qi mh for all thus the problem of computing the standard invariant of the subfactor associated to is the same as the computation of qi however such computations seem very hard and even for small and for matrices of small dimensions they seem to require computer use jones jo provided diagrammatic description of the relative commutants qi see also js which we express below in the framework of this paper let mn and let ei be its canonical matrix units let ei it is easy to check that is projection moreover dn mn and exe edn for all mn thus is realizing the basic construction dn mn let ek ei denote the matrix having only one non zero entry equal to at the intersection of row and column thus ek ei are matrix units of mn mn in what follows we subfactors and hadamard matrices will assume that the embedding of mn into mn mn is realized as ek ek in where ek in ek ei lemma let mn dn mn mn ei ei and in then dn mn is basic construction with jones projection and mn is basic construction with jones projection proof to show that dn mn is basic construction it is enough to check that mn and is implementing epmn first part is clear since ek ieei ek ei are basis for mn dn to check that implements the conditional expectation let xi mn we have in di di in dj dj dixdi di dixdi in edn in since dn mn is basic construction after tensoring to the left by mn it follows that mn is basic construction with in proposition the algebras constructed in are given by pk mn pk pk dn with the jones projections ek ki in ek ki in proof follows from the previous lemma by tensoring successively by mn wes camp and remus nicoara proposition let be complex hadamard matrix let jej ei udu then the algebras constructed in are given by qk ukpk where uk pk are the unitary elements uk iin in uk uk kin proof the unitary satisfies adu dn adu dn since du dn moreover we have adu adu ad jej ei ek adu kui lek ei adu adu it follows that adu takes the basic construction dn mn onto the inclusion udnu umn thus this is also basic construction which shows thatq umn moreover it follows that each adui takes the basic construction pi pi pi onto qi qi qi which ends the proof the first relative commutant udnu is equal to since the commuting square condition implies dn udnu thus the subfactor nh mh is irreducible in the following proposition we describe the higher relative commutants of the subfactor nh mh as the commutants of some matrices pi proposition with the previous notations let pi denote the projection uiei pi then we have the following formula for the th relative commutant qi pi subfactors and hadamard matrices proof we have qi adui pi adui pi adui pi pi we used the fact that pi pi pi is basic construction and thus pi pi remark the matrix ueu can be written as bea ec where ua iu iu iud this matrix is used in the theory of hadamard matrices and it is called the profile of it is result of jones jo that the matrices pi depend only on indeed one can check that pi ki li ki li ea ek ek eki li ec thus all higher relative commutants of even orders are determined by let \\u03b3h denote the graph of vertices in which the distinct vertices and are connected if and only if the second relative commutant can be easily described in terms of \\u03b3h we recall this in the following proposition which is reformulation of result in jo see also js proposition the second relative commutant of the subfactor nh mh is abelian its minimal projections are in bijection with the connected compo nents of \\u03b3h and their traces are proportional to the sizes of the connected components proof let iei ej be projection in the second relative commutant dn dn we have bea ec iei ej iei ej bea ec equivalently iea ec ei ej wes camp and remus nicoara by relabeling and identifying the set of indices it follows \\u03bbca thus if the vertices and are connected then \\u03bbca this ends the proof matrices of dita type in this section we investigate the standard invariant of subfactors associ ated to particular class of hadamard matrices obtained by construction of dita di which is generalization of an idea of haagerup these matrices have lot of symmetries and we show that for such matrices the sec ond relative commutant has some extra structure besides the jones projection let be non prime kl with let ai mk and bk mm be complex hadamard matrices it is possible to construct an hadamard matrix from bk by using an idea of di see also pe this construction is generalization of the tensor product of two hadamard matrices kbk kbk ak ak ak kbk let fi be the matrix units of mk we identify mn with the tensor product mm mk with the same conventions as before thus ai jbj fi one can use construct multi parametric families of non equivalent hadamard matrices by replacing bk by bd bkdk where dk are diag onal unitaries some of the families of hadamard matrices of small orders considered in the next section arise from this construction recall that the second relative commutant always contains the jones projec tion eii eii in the next proposition we show that the second relative commutant of dita type subfactor contains another projection so it has dimension at least proposition let ai jbj mn be dita type ma trix where ai mk and bk mm are complex subfactors and hadamard matrices hadamard matrices mk then the second relative commutant of the subfactor associated to contains the projection mod ei ej mn proof for let mod and im we will use similar notations for thus the entry of is hi ai jb where btr is the entry of bt for all with these notations the projection can be written as iei ej where if and for all other according to proposition showing that is in the second relative com mutant is equivalent to showing that whenever using the formula for the entries of and the fact that we obtain ui xu xu xud hi xh xh xhd ai xb ad xb ai xa xad xb ai xa xa xad xc xb ai xa xa xad x\\u03b4 whenever wes camp and remus nicoara we show that in fact the subfactor nh mh associated to the dita matrix has an intermediate subfactor nh rh mh and the projection is the bisch projection in the sense of bi corresponding to rh proposition let ai jbj fi mn be dita type matrix where ai mk and bk mm are complex hadamard matrices mk then the commuting square can be decomposed into two adjacent sym metric commuting squares dm dk mm mk dm ik mm dk dm dk the commuting square ct can be decomposed into two adjacent symmetric commuting squares dm dk mm mk im dk dm mk dm dk subfactors and hadamard matrices proof we first show that dm ik mm dk equivalently we check that dm ik mm dk indeed for dm we have ik fj ik ai jbj fi ai jb dbj fj ai dbj fj dbj fj jdbj fj mm dk the lower square of inclusions is clearly commuting square since is commuting square we check that dm dk mm mk dm ik mm dk is commuting square for mm and dk we have ai jbj fi fj jai jbjxb dj jfi wes camp and remus nicoara hence edn edn jai jbjxb dj jfi edm jai jbjxb dj j\\u03b4i fi dj jedm bjxb fi dj jedm bjxb ik dm ik the lower commuting square is symmetric since the product of the dimensions of its upper left and lower right corners equals the dimension of its upper right corner this also implies that the upper commuting square is symmetric since is symmetric the proof is similar to the proof of part corollary the subfactors associated to dita matrices have intermediate subfactors proof by iterating the basic construction for the decomposition of ct in commuting squares we obtain the towers of algebras dm dk mm mk im dk dm mk dm dk where ri ri ei xi let rh be the weak closure of iri we have nh rh mh and rh is ii factor since the subfactor nh mh is irreducible remark it is immediate to check that the projection mn mn from proposition implements the conditional expectation from mn in mn onto dm mk it follows that is the bisch projection for the intermediate subfactor nh rh mh subfactors and hadamard matrices matrices of small order in this section we compute the second relative commutants of the subfactors associated to hadamard matrices of small dimensions for some of the matrices considered we also specify the dimension of the third relative commutant most computations included were done with the help of computers using gap and mathematica it is well known in subfactor theory that the dimension of the second relative commutant is at most with equality if and only if is equivalent to tensor product of fourier matrices in this case the subfactor nh mh is well understood being cross product subfactor for this reason we exclude from our analysis tensor products of fourier matrices some of the matrices we present are parameterized and they yield contin uous families of complex hadamard matrices in such cases the strategy for computing the second relative commutant will be to determine which entries of the profile matrix depend on the parameters and for what values of the parameters are these entries according to proposition the second rela tive commutant will not change as long as the entries of do not change thus to compute the second relative commutant for any other value of the parameters it is enough to compute it for some random value we will describe the second relative commutant by specifying its minimal projections each such projection corresponds to subset is the diagonal matrix having on diagonal positions and on all other positions since the jones projection is always in the second relative commutant one of the subsets of our partitions will always be kn complex hadamard matrices of dimension there exists up to equivalence only one family of complex hadamard matrices of dimension the entries of that depend on the parameter are thus the second relative commutant is the same for all values of that are not roots of these equations the roots yield matrices that are tensor products of fourier matrices thus the dimension of the second relative commutant wes camp and remus nicoara is and its minimal projections are given by the partition the roots yield the fourier matrix thus the minimal projections are any other values of yield relative commutants of dimension this is not surprising since this matrix is of dita type see proposition the dimension of the third relative commutant is and the dimension of the fourth relative commutant is unless is primitive root of order of unity in which case the dimension is based on this evidence we conjecture that the principal graph of the subfactor associated to is if is primitive root of order of unity and otherwise complex hadamard matrices of dimension the fourier matrix is part of an affine parameter family of dita matrices the entries of that depend on are making one of these entries yields the following possibilities or or or or or or or or or or or in each of these cases the matrix is tensor product of fourier matrices for all other pairs satisfying the second relative commu tant has dimension subfactors and hadamard matrices the following family of self adjoint non affine complex hadamard matrices was obtained in ben one of the motivations being the search for hadamard matrices of small dimensions that might yield subfactors with no extra struc ture in their relative commutants besides the jones projections bn where arcos arcos and the variables are given by exp i\\u03b8 the entries of bn do not depend linearly on the parameters thus this is not dita type family the corresponding subfactors have the second relative commutant generated by the jones projection we conjecture thatbn give supertransitive subfactors all the relative commutants of higher orders are generated by the jones projections there are other interesting complex hadamard matrices of order such as the one found by tao in connection to fuglede conjecture or the haagerup matrix tz we computed the second relative commutant for these matrices and it is generated by the jones projection complex hadamard matrices of dimension the following one parameter family was found in pe providing counterexample to conjecture of popa regarding the finiteness of the number of complex hadamard matrices of prime dimension wes camp and remus nicoara the second relative commutant of the associated subfactors is generated by the jones projection for all for we also computed the third relative commutant and it is just the temperley lieb algebra tl we conjecture that yield subfactors with no extra structure in their higher order relative commutants besides the jones projections complex hadamard matrices of dimension the following parameter family of hadamard matrices contains the fourier matrix and is of dita type the list of possible values of that yield entries for is very long and we do not include it here outside these values the second rela tive commutant has dimension and it is given by we analysed several other complex hadamard matrices besides those in cluded in this paper such as those found by mrs sz we tried to cover subfactors and hadamard matrices most known examples of complex hadamard matrices of dimensions we draw some conclusions matrices of dita type yield subfactors with intermediate subfactors and thus the second relative commutant has some extra structure besides the jones projection we note that parametric families of dita type exist for every non prime and they contain the fourier matrix fn all non dita non fourier matrices we tested have the second relative commutant generated by the jones projection the third relative com mutant is also generated by the first two jones projections for all cases we could compute it remains an open problem whether there exist such complex hadamard
